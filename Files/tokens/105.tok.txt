four
years

hundreds
of
thousands
of
people
to
pursue
their
creative
dreams
through
the
comprehensive
week

according

quot
the

was
a
book
of
reunion
and
discovery
ah
hah
i
do
have
inside
me
an
artist
an
inner
youngster
who
had
been
lost
to
me
the
vein
of

is
a
book
of
healing
and
rehabilitation
i
ve
found
you
but
you
ve
been
beaten
battered
starved
malnourished
neglected
discounted
and
disowned
i
must
restore
you
to
health
so
we
can
have
our
adventures
quot
both
books
are
according
to
cameron
quot
the
distillate
of
years
of
artistic
practice
quot
it
is
my
belief
and
my
experience
as
a
teacher
that
all
of
us
are
healthy
enough
to
practise
creativity
it
is
not
a
dangerous
endeavour
requiring
trained
facilitators
it
is
our
human
birthright
and
something
we
can
do
gently
and
collectively
creativity
is
like
breathing
pointers
might
help
but
we
do
the
process
ourselves
after
the
vein
of
gold
s
initial
chapter
entitled
setting
out
which
brings
you
up
to
date
on
the
tools
of
the
artist
s
way
there
are
seven
chapters
of
essays
that
house
over
creative
tasks
which
take
us
through
the
various
kingdoms
as
a
journey
to
the
heart
of
creativity
the
following
are
two
of
the
seven
kingdoms
cameron
describes
included
is
a
task
and
one
of
the
quotes
of
other
artists
she
has
placed
in
the
margins
the
kingdom
of
story
divide
a
piece
of
notebook
paper
into
three
parts
horizontally
label
the
top
third
years
the
middle
is
years
the
bottom
third
is
years
on
additional
pieces
of
paper
move
through
your
life
in
five
year
increments
up
to
your
current
age
jotting
down
notes
in
answer
to
these
questions
where
did
you
live
who
were
your
major
players
any
significant
pets
what
were
your
favourite
foods
games
music
friend
toys
hobbies
interests
and
clothes
what
were
your
major
events
what
are
your
dominant
memories
the
challenge
then
is
to
be
the
creative
myth
maker
that
we
are
to
consciously
choose
our
myth
lest
it
be
chosen
for
us
by
the
collective
mind

capsule
collage
from
whatever
source
magazines
newspapers
catalogs
cereal
boxes
old
photo
collections
collect
and
save
images
that
in
some
way
resonate
with
your
memories
associations
and
life
experiences
from
years
one
to
five
don
t
be
too
literal
with
yourself
if
your
dominant
memory
of
your
toddler
s
bedroom
is
the
great
green
leafy
tree
outside
the
window
you
can
use
a
picture
of
the
rain
forest
or
even
a
salad
if
that
green
works
for
you
in
conjuring
up
the
association
remember
you
are
both
the
i
and
the
eye
in
this
exercise
it
is
not
necessary
to
know
why
an
image
speaks
to
you
the
fact
that
it
does
is
connection
enough
take
about
minutes
and
swiftly
lay
the
images
down
on
poster
board
i
prefer
working
with
old
fashioned
elmer
s
glue
although
there
are
those
who
swear
by
glue
sticks
feel
free
to
add
words
or
glitter
to
outline
with
magic
marker
or
dabble
with
paints
this
is
your
collage
and
it
is
meant
to
reflect
your
child
self
try
to
let
yourself
go
back
to
that
child
and
remember
you
may
want
to
set
aside
time
each
day
for
a
week
to
move
another
five
years
further
with
your
time
capsule
collage
you
may
also
want
to
hang
these
collages
for
a
while
a
hallway
hung
with
a
row
of
them
becomes
a
visual
narrative
time
line
not
unlike
a
home
movie
the
local
painters
were
my
idols
these
artists
too
were
grown
ups
but
they
were
grown
ups
who
could
still
see
their
eye
was
still
in
love
like
mine
