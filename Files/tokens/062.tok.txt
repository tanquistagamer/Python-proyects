the
distributed
architecture
for
mobile
navigation
damn
is
a
behavior
based
architecture
similar
in
spirit
to
the
subsumption
architecture
in
contrast
to
more
traditional
centralized
ai
planners
that
build
a
world
model
and
plan
an
optimal
path
through
it
a
behavior
based
architecture
consists
of
specialized
task
achieving
modules
that
operate
independently
and
are
responsible
for
only
a
very
narrow
portion
of
vehicle
control
thus
avoiding
the
need
for
sensor
fusion
a
distributed
architecture
has
several
advantages
over
a
centralized
one
including
greater
reactivity
flexibility
and
robustness
the
figure
below
shows
the
organization
of
the
damn
system
in
which
individual
behaviors
such
as
road
following
and
obstacle
avoidance
send
steering
or
speed
commands
the
command
arbitration
module
which
combines
these
inputs
into
a
single
steering
direction
and
speed
command
within
the
framework
of
damn
behaviors
provide
the
task
specific
knowledge
for
controlling
the
vehicle
each
behavior
runs
completely
independently
and
asynchronously
providing
votes
to
its
appropriate
arbiter
each
at
its
own
rate
and
according
to
its
own
time
constraints
the
arbiter
periodically
combines
all
the
latest
commands
from
each
behavior
and
issues
a
command
to
the
vehicle
controller
in
order
to
allow
multiple
considerations
to
affect
vehicle
actions
concurrently
damn
uses
a
scheme
where
each
behavior
votes
for
or
against
each
of
a
set
of
possible
vehicle
actions
an
arbiter
then
performs
command
fusion
to
select
the
most
appropriate
action
for
example
vehicle
commands
such
as
steering
turn
radius
are
discretized
into
a
fixed
set
of
possible
alternatives
and
each
behavior
then
votes
for
or
against
each
command
option
with
varying
weights
reflecting
the
relative
priority
of
the
behaviors
the
arbiter
then
computes
a
weighted
sum
of
the
votes
it
has
received
from
each
behavior
and
the
command
choice
with
the
highest
value
is
selected
and
issued
to
the
vehicle
controller
damn
is
designed
so
that
various
behaviors
can
be
easily
added
or
removed
from
the
system
depending
on
the
current
task
at
hand
behaviors
that
have
been
used
include
one
that
interfaces
to
the
alvinn
road
following
system
to
the
ganesha
obstacle
mapping
system
to
the
stripe
teleoperation
system
and
to
various
other
navigation
modules

each
of
the
subsystems
