an
overview
of
pcmdi
the
program
for
climate
model
diagnosis
and
intercomparison
pcmdi
was
established
in
at
the
lawrence
livermore
national
laboratory
llnl
in
the
san
francisco
bay
area
our
staff
includes
research
scientists
computer
scientists
and
support
personnel
there
are
several
means
of
communicating
with
pcmdi
mission
pcmdi
s
principal
mission
is
to
develop
improved
methods
and
tools
for
the
diagnosis
validation
and
intercomparison
of
global
climate
models
gcms
what
we
call
a
climate
modeling
infrastructure
pcmdi
scientists
also
engage
in
research
on
a
wide
variety
of
outstanding
problems
in
climate
modeling
and
analysis
the
need
for
standards
in
both
modeling
and
analysis
has
become
increasingly
apparent
as
more
complex
models
are
developed
while
the
disagreement
among
models
and
between
models
and
observations
remains
significant
and
poorly
understood
the
nature
and
causes
of
these
disagreements
must
be
accounted
for
in
a
systematic
fashion
before
models
can
be
confidently
used
for
climate
sensitivity
and
predictability
studies

research
climate
modeling
infrastructure
pcmdi
staff
members
devote
a
significant
share
of
their
time
to
the
development
of
climate
modeling
infrastructure
examples
include
ongoing
construction
of
documentation
validation
data
and
analysis
tools
and
software
products
designed
specifically
for
global
climate
modeling
and
analysis
the
atmospheric
model
intercomparison
project
amip
as
a
preliminary
contribution
to
model
diagnosis
and
intercomparison
under
standardized
conditions
pcmdi
is
coordinating
the
atmospheric
model
intercomparison
project
amip
on
behalf
of
the
working
group
on
numerical
experimentation
wgne
of
the
world
climate
research
programme
wcrp
in
this
project
some
amip
modeling
groups
are
simulating
the
climate
of
the
decade
using
the
observed
monthly
sea
surface
temperature
and
sea
ice
as
well
as
common
values
of
solar
luminosity
w
m
and
atmospheric
carbon
dioxide
concentration
ppm
the
participating
models
principal
numerical
algorithms
and
dynamical
physical
parameterizations
are
summarized
in
amip
model
documentation
a
set
of
monthly
mean
standard
output
data
from
each
amip
model
is
archived
at
pcmdi
and
some
amip
modeling
groups
have
also
provided
history
data
at
six
hourly
intervals
analysis
of
the
models
performance
in
comparison
with
observational
data
reveals
their
systematic
errors
while
comparison
of
the
amip
simulations
with
each
other
provides
a
measure
of
current
modeling
uncertainties
more
focussed
analyses
of
the
models
ability
to
simulate
specific
processes
and
phenomena
are
being
carried
out
by
more
than
two
dozen
amip
diagnostic
subprojects
in
which
pcmdi
is
playing
a
supporting
role
the
results
of
this
diagnosis
and
intercomparison
of
the
amip
model
simulations
were
extensively
discussed
at
an
international
amip
scientific
conference
in
may
of
pcmdi
research
pcmdi
scientists
are
conducting
amip
studies
both
independently
and
in
association
with
amip
diagnostic
subprojects
we
are
testing
regional
and
hemispheric
validation
techniques
spanning
synoptic
to
interannual
time
scales
in
an
effort
to
evaluate
the
fidelity
with
which
models
can
simulate
observations
pcmdi
has
extensively
studied
the
effects
of
spatial
and
temporal
resolution
on
climate
simulations
performed
with
the
european
centre
for
medium
range
weather
forecasts
ecmwf
atmospheric
model
and
the
semtner
chervin
ocean
model
in
addition
we
are
examining
the
natural
variability
of
simulated
seasonal
and
interannual
climate
in
studies
of
ensemble
integrations
of
the
ecmwf
model
from
different
initial
conditions
pcmdi
has
conducted
several
exploratory
studies
of
the
use
of
nonlinear
and
common
principal
components
for
model
data
and
model
model
intercomparisons
we
also
are
developing
statistical
techniques
for
detection
of
climate
change
by
external
forcing
such
as
greenhouse
warming
against
the
background
of
internal
variability
of
the
atmosphere
and
ocean
collaborations
pcmdi
scientists
are
collaborating
with
a
number
of
amip
diagnostic
subprojects
some
of
this
work
is
coordinated
with
other
wcrp
wgne
initiatives
such
as
the
monsoon
numerical
experimentation
group
moneg
and
the
gewex
sponsored
project
for
intercomparison
of
land
surface
parameterization
schemes
pilps
pcmdi
also
is
supporting
the
feedback
analysis
for
gcm
intercomparison
and
observations
fangio
project
through
the
development
of
prototype
diagnostics
to
identify
important
radiative
feedbacks
in
addition
we
are
collaborating
with
the
paleoclimatic
model
intercomparison
project
pmip
for
which
pcmdi
is
providing
data
storage
and
diagnostic
software
pcmdi
computer
scientists
also
have
worked
with
colleagues
at
the
national
energy
research
supercomputer
center
nersc
and
in
the
optimass
project
at
the
lawrence
berkeley
national
laboratory
lbnl
to
develop
innovative
data
access
translation
and
storage
algorithms
and
software
software
tools
an
important
component
of
pcmdi
s
work
is
the
development
testing
and
distribution
of
software
tools
for
the
access
storage
diagnosis
and
visualization
of
data
a
comprehensive
climate
database
management
system
cdms
is
currently
under
development
at
pcmdi
this
tool
will
provide
efficient
access
of
information
from
both
our
model
and
observational
data
archives
validation
data
because
validation
is
central
to
the
diagnosis
and
intercomparison
of
global
climate
models
pcmdi
is
developing
observational
data
products
as
an
essential
element
of
a
climate
modeling
infrastructure
our
current
priority
is
to
accumulate
observational
data
including
especially
reanalyses
from
the
amip
period
of
but
a
longer
term
goal
is
to
acquire
quality
datasets
that
are
generally
useful
for
climate
model
validation
future
plans
during
the
next
few
years
pcmdi
will
continue
its
efforts
to
develop
a
climate
modeling
infrastructure
consisting
of
standards
and
software
for
documentation
data
management
diagnosis
visualization
validation
intercomparison
and
exchange
in
cooperation
with
the
climate
community
much
of
this
effort
will
be
directed
to
supporting
the
next
phase
of
the
amip
designated
as
amip
ii
in
the
longer
term
we
will
progressively
shift
our
emphasis
from
atmospheric
models
to
models
of
the
coupled
ocean
atmosphere
system
and
will
support
the
development
of
a
coupled
model
intercomparison
project
cmip
in
cooperation
with
the
clivar
initiative
of
the
world
climate
research
programme
pcmdi
also
will
address
specific
questions
that
are
important
model
related
elements
of
global
change
research
these
include
consideration
of
how
to
most
effectively
control
the
unrealistic
climate
drift
that
is
typical
of
coupled
systems
and
how
simulated
natural
variability
may
be
used
in
the
study
of
climate
predictability
and
the
detection
of
climate
change
on
global
and
regional
scales
this
research
supported
by
a
climate
modeling
infrastructure
will
provide
the
basis
for
the
systematic
application
and
improvement
of
models
and
for
the
comprehensive
evaluation
of
their
ability
to
characterize
future
climate
changes
as
a
result
of
anthropogenic
activities
