dr
theresa
crenshaw
a
san
diego
physician
and
sex
therapist
credits
it
with
a
broad
range
of
physical
and
emotional
benefits
ranging
from
providing
a
sense
of
comfort
to
boosting
the
immune
system
and
stabilizing
blood
pressure
although
the
body
of
scientific
evidence
proving
the
benefits
of
touch
is
still
slim
the
consequences
of
touch
deprivation
are
well
documented
decades
of
studies
on
newborns
and
the
elderly
reaching
back
to
the
s
have
shown
physical
and
mental
suffering
from
lack
of
touch
even
if
all
other
basic
needs
were
met
touch
deprivation
is
just
as
destructive
to
health
as
lack
of
vitamin
