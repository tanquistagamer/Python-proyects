yeltsin
fails
to
punish
journalists
murderers
by
catherine
a
fitzpatrick
although
boris
yeltsin
won
the
russian
presidential
elections
the
russian
media
which
opted
unabashedly
to
back
the
president
may
have
lost
paradoxically
while
the
independent
media
have
thrived
under
yeltsin
in
many
ways
to
the
point
where
lionizing
the
president
was
considered
a
free
editorial
decision
the
press
has
suffered
its
most
violent
attacks
in
decades
cpj
has
confirmed
that
journalists
have
been
assassinated
since
and
four
are
missing
and
presumed
dead
making
russia
one
of
the
most
dangerous
countries
in
the
world
for
journalists
through
his
government
s
failure
to
fully
investigate
let
alone
prosecute
these
cases
yeltsin
has
signaled
that
reporters
may
be
killed
with
impunity
these
attacks
do
not
necessarily
emanate
from
the
president
s
office
but
stem
from
his
historical
lack
of
control
over
the
power
ministries
army
police
and
security
and
from
the
ministries
failure
in
turn
to
control
violent
groups
in
society
the
much
ballyhooed
clean
sweep
of
corrupt
ministries
by
new
security
chief
gen
alexander
lebed
is
no
substitute
for
the
institutionalized
watchdog
function
of
a
free
press
nor
does
it
address
the
dangers
faced
by
journalists
who
probe
topics
like
corruption
in
the
army
or
in
business
in
alone
three
journalists
were
gunned
down
in
or
near
their
homes
and
three
were
assassinated
in
chechnya
several
more
were
brutally
beaten
and
others
narrowly
escaped
assaults
or
were
threatened

russian

chechen

believing
she
was
a

acting
on
rumors
spread
by
the

many
journalists
confirm
the
fsb
s
role
in
discrediting
those
who
report
on
chechnya
or
other
security
related
topics
summonses
for
chats
at
the
fsb
and
invitations
to
collaborate
or
face
career
difficulties
are
still
a
fact
of
life
which
journalists
fear
publicizing
one
reporter
for
instance
was
warned
to
stop
covering
a
controversial
story
or
else
your
personal
security

be

the

it
is
not

that
journalists
have
greeted

purges
with
skepticism
without
the
prosecution
of

attackers
and
a

journalists
in
russia
will
not
be
free
to
provide
the
kind
of
probes
into
official
corruption
so
necessary
to
a
democratic
society
those
in

who
stand
aside
while

are
killed
with

cannot
