ds
has
been
designed
to
provide
a
robotic
development
platform
for
research
applications
this
system
allows
all
of
the
command
modes
of
the
standard
aesop
system
but
also
adds
the
flexibility
of
pc
communication
directly
with
the
aesop
controller
the
flexibility
of
the
ds
system
allows
a
platform
for
building
new
robotic
applications
and
laparoscopic
research
system
usage
the
ds
system
like
the
aesop
is
intended
for
use
in
a
laparoscopic
setting
where
the
robot

system
software
a

transfer
program
and
a
library
of
movement
and
data
collection
routines
to
use
the
system
aesop
is

software
can
then
be
loaded
through
the
serial
port
once
this
is
done
the
system
can
be

foot
and
hand
controls
manual
mode
and
memory
positions
the

data
to
and
receive
data
from
the
aesop
system
a
library
of
commands
is
provided

a
floppy
disk
for
example
the
robot
s
individual
joints
can
be
commanded
to

to
specific
locations
the
system
can
send
back
information
about
joint
positions
and
movement
histories
in
addition
other
interfaces
may
be
used
to
control
the
robot
for
example
the
robot
could
be
moved
