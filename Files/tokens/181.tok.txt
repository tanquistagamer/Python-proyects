trends
of
executive
summary
from
interviews
with
industry
leaders
and
analysis
of
recent
events
it
is
possible
to
connect
some
of
the
dots
and
make
educated
guesses
about
what
holds
in
store
for
wireless
the
way
larry
vanston
sees
it
the
year
ahead
will
be
a
lot
like
in
the
world
of
wireless
telecommunications
this
is
to
say
that
will
be
another
year
of
record
setting
growth
heightened
competition
and
rapid
techno
logical
change
for
the
industry
according
to
vanston
president
of
austin
texas
based
consultants
technology
futures
inc
vanston
and
other
observers
surveyed
by
wb
f
said
it
may
well
be
that
the
industry
is
in
for
a
year
when
the
pace
of
developments
if
anything
gains
more
momentum
such
an
acceleration
is
seen
occurring
across
a
broad
front
mani
fested
by
prices
for
services
driven
lower
as
more
competitors
arrive
on
the
scene
and
by
a
stream
of
technological
advances
and
against
a
backdrop
where
wireless
telephony
becomes
a
widespread
reality
in
more
markets
overseas
but
this
is
not
to
say
that
there
are
no
clouds
on
the
wireless
horizon
indeed
renewed
signs
of
a
slowdown
in
the
u
s
cellular
market
the
world
s
largest
in
terms
of
absolute
subscribers
have
dampened
the
growth
outlook
for
network
operators
and
for
handset
and
infrastructure
manufacturers
as
nokia
corp
noted
dec
despite
improvement
in
nokia
s
u
s
mobile
phone
business
growth
and
profitability
in
nokia
mobile
phones
have
developed
somewhat
below
plan
that
sent
the
price
of
nokia
s
american
depositary
receipts
tumbling
for
the
second
time
in
two
months
page
however
it
was
unclear
at
press
time
whether
handset
manufacturers
in
general
faced
a
repeat
of
the
overages
that
built
up
in
their
u
s
inventories
during
the
christmas
season
all
the
same
wall
streeters
are
a
notoriously
fickle
bunch
and
any
fall
off
in
domestic
wireless
growth
should
be
measured
against
the
blistering
ex
pansion
that
the
u
s
market
enjoyed
during
and
the
first
half
of
net
subscriber
additions
simply
could
not
be
sustained
forever
at
such
an
ex
plosive
rate
and
cellular
s
long
term
growth
pattern
seems
firmly
intact
by
the
end
of
it
is
conceivable
that
there
will
be
million
cellu
lar
subscribers
in
the
united
states
a
gain
of
million
in
a
month
span
all
eyes
turn
to
pcs
big
changes
are
destined
to
sweep
the
u
s
wireless
market
this
year
as
the
industry
comes
to
grips
with
the
probable
enactment
of
legislation
aimed
at
deregulating
telecommunications
this
would
give
network
operators
the
statu
tory
certainty
they
need
to
move
forward
with
big
purchases
of
new
equipment
said
matthew
flanagan
president
of
the
telecommunications

association
arlington
va
moreover
the
u
s
market
is
on
the
verge
of
entering
a
new
phase
with
the
advent
of

personal
communications
services
pcs
it
may
be
another
year
yet
before

marketed
on
a
large

but
pcs

are
betting
big
bucks
that
both
lower
price
points
and
the
digitally
enhanced
sound
quality
of
calls
placed
over

will
prove
appealing
to
consumers
who
have
disdained
cellular
as
too
costly
and
to
at
least
some
cellular

this

challenges

the
lead

for
its

mtel
continues

what
alex

concerns
surrounding
the
company
s
skytel
way
advanced
messaging
service
competition
consolidation
and
convergence
more
of
the
same
only
more
so
perhaps
the
most
important
issue
before
the
wireless
industry
is
how
to
compete
effectively
on
a
landscape
that
seemingly
keeps
shifting
beneath
its
feet
for
many
wireless
players
achieving
scale
is
the
way
to
maximize
their
competitive
ability
this
consolidation
trend
has
been
most
pronounced
in
paging
where
arch

group
inc

airtouch
paging
announced
the
most
recent

giving
them
about

fice
it
to

acqui
sitions

lack
of
handsets
seen
impeding
dual
band
gsm
services
cellular
operators
that
employ
global
system
for
mobile
communications
gsm
technology
in
their
networks
should
think
long
and
hard
about
pairing
their
services
with
gsm
s
higher
frequency
counterparts
dcs
and
pcs
so
says
toni
stadelmann
deputy
managing
director
of
mobile
services
for
swiss
telecom
which
has
deployed
a
dcs
personal
communi
cations
network
pcn
in
geneva
to
go
with
its
nationwide
gsm
cellular
network
while
its
experience
with
pcn
has
been
limited
the
geneva
system
was
rolled
out
to
coincide
with
the
telecom
trade
show
and
conference
last
october
the
ptt
plans
to
introduce
dcs
service
in
zurich
and
basel
next
fall
as
a
capacity
enhancing
supplement
to
mhz
cel
lular
in
these
high
traffic
markets
stadelmann
told
the
pcs
in
north
america
conference
in
washington
last
month
in
the
long
run
he
said
the
company
hopes
to
reach
roaming
agreements
that
would
tie
its
pcn
service
together
with
europe
s
gsm
cellular
operators
and
countries
that
either
have
pcn
already
the
united
kingdom
germany
and
france
or
are
contemplating
pcn
rollouts
including
sweden
and
italy
but
there
is
one
sizable
problem
wireless
equipment
manufacturers
need
to
speed
up
efforts
to
bring
dual
band
mobile
phones
to
market
the
subject
of
gsm
dcs
handsets
also
came
up
during
another
recent
meeting
in
washington
i
don
t
know
of
any
vendor
today
committed
to
developing
these
handsets
malcolm
cowan
general
manager
of
the
richardson
texas
based
pcs
business
unit
of
northern
telecom
ltd
told
the
pcs
strategies
conference
if
recent
contract
announcements
are
any
indication
however
finland
s
nokia
corp
may
be
the
first
to
take
the
plunge
the
company
has
signed
a
two
year
contract
with
telia
mobitel
the
biggest
gsm
cellular
network
in
sweden
for
the
delivery
of
base
station
subsystems
that
can
be
used
either
for
a
stand
alone
dcs
network
or
a
seamless
dual
band
service
the
base
stations
are
designed
to
bolster
capacity
in
areas
with
heavy
calling
traffic
as
well
as
to
improve
indoor
coverage
savings
on
fixed
and
operating
costs
more
flexibility
in
setting
rates
nokia
s
other
recent
gsm
dcs
infrastructure
deals
were
with
nordictel
holdings
of
sweden
and
sonofon
of
denmark
it
also
was
the
vendor
for
swiss
telecom
s
dcs
system
for
swiss
telecom
scheduled
to
face
competition
in
pcn
beginning
in
when
spectrum
set
aside
for
private
operators
will
be
opened
up
pairing
gsm
and
dcs
will
afford
cost
advantages
in
the
areas
of
infrastructure
its
trans
mission
network
and
customer
service
and
billing
stadelmann
said
according
to
an
analysis
in
which
the
ptt
assigned
different
weightings
to
these
cost
areas
potential
savings
of
percent
can
be
had
percent
on
both
transmission
network
and
billing
customer
service
expenses
and
another
percent
on
infrastructure
costs
moreover
in
limiting
its
pcn
coverage
to
urban
areas
stadelmann
said
that
swiss
telecom
has
found
that
it
can
devise
a
rate
structure
that
offers
greater
appeal
to
the
more
price
conscious
segment
of
the
wire
less
voice
market
by
setting
rates
close
to
those
of
the
wireline
network
swiss
telecom
hopes
to
induce
customers
to
switch
over
to
pcn
from
the
fixed
network
for
the
mobility
it
affords
but
that
of
course
first
would
require
a
more
robust
roaming
capability
all
stadelmann
could
do
last
month
was
ask
rhetorically
what
are
the
manufacturers
doing
he
would
like
to
see
action
sooner
rather
than
later

the

put
