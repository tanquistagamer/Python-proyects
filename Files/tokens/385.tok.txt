personal

law
general
personal
injuries
as
their
name
implies
are
injuries
to
an
individual
person
crimes
are
wrongful
acts
against
society
the
government
punishes
those
who
commit
crimes
with
criminal
penalties
for
personal
injuries
the
government
does
not
punish
the
wrongdoer
but
gives
the
victim
the
right
to
pursue
a
private
civil
lawsuit
called
a
tort
action
against
the
wrongdoer
some
wrongful
acts
are
both
crimes
and
torts
and
can
subject
the
wrongdoer
to
both
criminal
penalties
and
tort
remedies
this
chapter
outlines
the
actions
that
lead
to
most
personal
injury
lawsuits
including
general
accidents
and
injuries
use
of
defective

occurring

actions
that
result

related
accidents
the
personal
injury
law
medical
amp
professional
malpractice
chapter
discusses
medical
and
legal
negligence
general
concepts
of
tort
law
tort
laws
are
based
on
the
premise
that
when
someone
does
something
to
harm
another
person
physically
mentally
or
financially
the
person
harmed
ought
to
be
compensated
for
the
loss
tort
lawsuits
are
governed
by
a
set
of
rules
that
are
different
from
the
rules
that
govern
criminal
lawsuits
degree
of
fault
needed
to
recover
there
are
three
kinds
of
torts
negligence
intentional
misconduct
and
strict
liability
each
requires
the
plaintiff
to
show
a
different
degree
of
fault
to
recover
from
the
defendant
negligence
a
person
is
negligent
if
he
or
she
fails
to
act
as
a
reasonable
person
would
act
in
a
similar
situation
examples
of
negligence
include
inattentive
driving
that
causes
an
automobile
accident
or
a
store
owner
failing
to
repair
a
defective
escalator
that
causes
a
fall
if
a
reasonable
person
would
have
driven
attentively
or
if
a
reasonable
store
owner
would
have
fixed
the
unsafe
escalator
the
person
who
drove
inattentively
or
failed
to
make
repairs
could
be
found
negligent
by
a
judge
or
jury
negligent
behavior
is
almost
never
criminal
intentional
misconduct
intentional
misconduct
occurs
when
someone
acting
deliberately
does
something
that
hurts
another
person
or
damages
that
person
s
property
the
law
does
not
require
that
the
person
intend
to
cause
the
injury
he
or
she
actually
inflicts
only
that
he
or
she
acted
deliberately
or
with
complete
indifference
toward
a
person
s
own
safety
or
the
safety
of
others
for
example
a
driver
of
an
automobile
may
intend
only
to
scare
a
pedestrian
by
swerving
toward
the
pedestrian
but
if
the
driver
hits
the
pedestrian
the
driver
commits
intentional
misconduct
intentional
misconduct
can
be
more
difficult
to
prove
than
negligence
but
often
a
plaintiff
can
recover
greater
damages
if
he
or
she
can
show
the
defendant
acted
intentionally
intentional
misconduct
is
often
criminal
behavior
also
examples
of
intentional
misconduct
include
assault
and
battery
strict
liability
in
some
situations
a
plaintiff
can
recover
for
injuries
received
even
if
the
defendant
uses
utmost
care
in
these
situations
a
defendant
is
said
to
be
strictly
or
absolutely
liable
for
any
damages
resulting
from
his
or
her
actions
the
principle
behind
strict
liability
is
that
some
activities
are
necessary
but
so
dangerous
that
even
a
reasonable
person
cannot
make
them
completely
safe
as
a
social
policy
defendants
are
permitted
to
engage
in
certain
activities
but
are
held
strictly
liable
for
any
injury
resulting
from
the
activity
strict
liability
claims
most
commonly
result
from
extremely
dangerous
activities
such
as
blasting
excavating
or
demolishing
a
building
or
from
defective
products
comparative
fault
tort
law
attempts
to
compensate
victims
if
their
injuries
are
caused
by
another
person
when
one
person
clearly
causes
all
of
another
person
s
injury
blame
is
easy
to
place
in
many
other
cases
however
the
victim
s
actions
help
cause
the
injury
or
make
it
worse
than
it
would
otherwise
be
for
instance
a
negligent
driver
might
injure
a
pedestrian
who
is
negligently
walking
in
the
street
instead
of
on
a
sidewalk
where
a
prudent
pedestrian
normally
walks
a
person
injured
by
a
defective
chain
saw
may
have
suffered
more
severe
injuries
by
negligently
failing
to
wear
safety
goggles
while
using
the
chain
saw
in
these
cases
a
judge
or
jury
must
calculate
how
much
each
party
is
at
fault
each
state
has
its
own
rules
for
calculating
damages
that
can
be
recovered
when
a
victim
is
at
least
partially
to
blame
for
his
or
her
own
injury
illinois
has
a
comparative
fault
rule
under
the
comparative
fault
rule
a
judge
reduces
the
amount
of
any
damage
award
by
the
percent
that
the
victim
s
own
actions
contributed
to
his
or
her
injuries
for
example
if
a
jury
finds
that
a
plaintiff
suffered
in
damages
but
was
percent
at
fault
the
judge
reduces
the
damage
award
by
percent
to
the
reduction
may
be
made
only
up
to
percent
if
the
victim
is
more
than
percent
at
fault
he
or
she
collects
nothing
vicarious
liability
there
are
several
ways
a
person
can
be
held
liable
for
the
actions
of
another
person
this
is
known
as
vicarious
liability
for
example
a
parent
might
be
held
responsible
for
damage
caused
by
his
or
her
child
if
the
parent
knows
that
the
child
is
likely
to
injure
someone
the
parent
has
the
ability
to
control
the
child
and
the
parent
negligently
fails
to
exercise
any
control
over
the
child
the
owner
of
a
vehicle
can
be
held
responsible
for
accidents
caused
when
another
person
drives
the
vehicle
if
the
owner
negligently
entrusts
the
vehicle
to
the
other
driver
the
most
common
form
of
vicarious
liability
is
called
respondeat
superior
under
respondeat
superior
an
employer
is
responsible
for
torts
committed
by
employees
within
the
scope
of
their
employment
a
business
owner
is
not
usually
responsible
for
acts
committed
by
independent
contractors
for
example
if
a
pedestrian
is
struck
and
injured
by
a
person
driving
to
a
party
the
victim
has
a
claim
against
the
driver
if
the
pedestrian
is
hit
by
a
person
driving
a
delivery
van
for
his
or
her
employer
then
respondeat
superior
gives
the
pedestrian
claims
against
both
the
driver
and
the
employer
as
a
practical
matter
personal
injury
plaintiffs
often
focus
their
recovery
efforts
on
the
employers
because
employers
usually
have
more
money
or
better
insurance
burden
of
proof
the
burden
of
proof
in
a
civil
lawsuit
is
less
strict
than
the
proof
required
in
a
criminal
case
in
a
criminal
case
the
state
must
prove
a
person
s
guilt
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
the
state
is
required
to
meet
this
high
standard
because
a
defendant
s
liberty
and
possibly
even
life
are
at
stake
the
plaintiff
in
a
personal
injury
lawsuit
need
only
show
that
it
is
more
probable
than
not
that
an
injury
was
caused
by
the
defendant
s
actions
if
the
jury
finds
that
the
evidence
even
slightly
favors
the
injured
party
then
it
must
find
for
the
plaintiff
the
personal
injury
plaintiff
need
only
meet
this
lower
standard
because
the
defendant
s
life
and
liberty
are
not
at
stake
defenses
sometimes
people
are
allowed
or
privileged
to
commit
acts
that
otherwise
constitute
assault
or
battery
and
not
be
liable
for
damages
if
one
acts
in
defense
of
self
others
or
one
s
land
the
use
of
force
can
be
justified
illinois
has
a
good
samaritan
law
that
states
that
a
civilian
has
no
duty
to
provide
aid
to
an
injured
person
however
once
a
person
voluntarily
assists
someone
he
or
she
becomes
liable
for
any
injury
that
results
from
the
failure
to
exercise
due
care
law
enforcement
officials
and
firefighters
have
a
defense
to
liability
if
they
injure
someone
while
providing
good
faith
emergency
care
for
example
if
a
firefighter
responds
to
a
call
and
in
trying
to
help
the
victim
accidentally
worsens
the
victim
s
injury
the
firefighter
has
a
defense
to
charges
of
assault
and
battery
damages
the
damages
a
victim
may
collect
depend
on
the
type
of
tort
alleged
for
torts
to
the
body
a
plaintiff
can
collect
lost
wages
diminished
earning
capacity
costs
of
medical
care
pain
and
suffering
for
torts
to
property
a
plaintiff
can
recover
diminished
value
of
the
property
replacement
costs
or
cost
of
repair
in
a
lawsuit
alleging
intentional
misconduct
the
plaintiff
often
may
be
able
to
recover
punitive
damages
in
addition
to
any
awards
for
injuries
pain
and
suffering
punitive
damages
designed
to
punish
people
or
organizations
for
unlawful
acts
are
usually
very
large
sums
of
money
until
recently
there
were
few
limits
to
punitive
damages
although
federal
and
state
legislatures
have
recently
passed
laws
capping
punitive
damages
in
certain
types
of
cases
it
can
still
be
to
the
plaintiff
s
advantage
to
convince
a
jury
that
injuries
were
the
result
of
an
intentional
act
and
not
mere
negligence
a
wrongful
death
lawsuit
is
a
lawsuit
filed
by
the
surviving
relatives
of
a
person
for
example
under
illinois
law
any
dependent
heirs
such
as
sons
or
daughters
of
a
person
killed
by
a
defective
product
can
sue
the
manufacturer
for
loss
of
that
person
s
future
income
surviving
relatives
cannot
however
sue
a
manufacturer
to
collect
damages
for
the
pain
and
suffering
of
a
person
wrongfully
killed
by
a
manufacturer
s
defective
product
however
the
estate
of
the
deceased
person
can
sue
to
collect
money
needed
to
pay
any
bills
for
medical
treatment
received
by
the
person
before
he
or
she
died
a
surviving
spouse
can
sue
for
damages
to
recover
for
loss
of
advice
comfort
assistance
and
protection
illinois
recognizes
a
viable
fetus
as
a
person
therefore
any
personal
injury
action
that
can
be
brought
by
one
who
was
born
can
also
be
brought
on
behalf
of
an
unborn
viable
fetus
suing
the
government
there
was
a
time
when
citizens
could
not
sue
the
government
for
torts
committed
by
government
employees
the
federal
and
state
governments
enjoyed
complete
immunity
from
tort
lawsuits
this
immunity
has
been
partially
waived
but
there
are
limits
on
tort
actions
against
the
government
although
the
federal
and
most
state
governments
now
permit
suits
for
personal
injuries
suffered
because
of
the
negligence
of
a
government
employee
or
as
a
result
of
a
dangerous
condition
on
government
property
there
are
limits
on
how
much
can
be
collected
and
when
a
suit
must
be
initiated
typically
the
state
of
illinois
may
only
be
sued
in
the
court
of
claims
for
actions
of
breach
of
contract
with
the
state
tort
by
an
agent
of
the
state
and
tort
by
an
escaped
inmate
areas
of
personal
injury
practice
lawyers
practicing
general
personal
injury
law
generally
fall
into
one
of
three
practice
areas
product
liability
general
accidents
and
injuries
and
workers
compensation
product
liability
injuries
resulting
from
defective
products
are
the
basis
of
some
personal
injury
lawsuits
product
liability
lawsuits
frequently
receive
attention
in
the
media
stories
of
people
recovering
damages
for
faulty
breast
implants
exploding
gas
tanks
or
flammable
children
s
clothing
all
make
headlines
because
a
faulty
product
line
can
injure
many
people
product
liability
lawsuits
are
sometimes
brought
as
class
action
lawsuits
in
which
many
injured
people
the
class
bring
one
united
lawsuit
against
the
manufacturer
share
legal
costs
and
split
any
award
product
liability
claims
usually
rely
on
one
of
three
theories
strict
liability
negligence
or
breach
of
warranty
each
of
these
has
its
standards
and
potential
damages
often
a
single
injury
leads
a
plaintiff
to
bring
claims
under
all
three
theories
against
the
manufacturer
for
example
a
person
injured
when
a
microwave
oven
explodes
might
allege
that
the
oven
s
manufacturer
breached
a
warranty
negligently
manufactured
the
oven
and
that
the
oven
was
so
dangerous
that
its
manufacturer
should
be
held
strictly
liable
for
all
injuries
it
caused
strict
product
liability
strict
liability
makes
the
manufacturer
of
a
product
liable
to
someone
injured
while
using
the
product
if
the
product
was
unreasonably
dangerous
this
theory
focuses
on
the
product
itself
in
illinois
a
person
alleging
strict
product
liability
must
show
that
the
product
was
in
a
defective
condition
so
that
it
was
unreasonably
dangerous
even
if
used
for
its
intended
purpose
the
defect
existed
when
the
product
left
the
manufacturer
s
control
the
defect
caused
the
plaintiff
s
injury
for
example
if
a
chair
had
a
defective
leg
that
made
it
unsafe
to
sit
on
the
leg
was
defective
when
the
chair
left
the
manufacturer
and
that
weak
leg
caused
injury
to
a
person
who
fell
after
sitting
in
the
chair
the
manufacturer
may
be
strictly
liable
for
damages
negligent
design
or
manufacture
manufacturers
can
be
sued
for
negligence
if
a
manufacturer
negligently
designs
or
manufactures
a
product
the
manufacturer
is
liable
to
those
hurt
by
the
product
unlike
strict
liability
theory
which
focuses
on
the
product
negligence
claims
focus
on
the
manufacturer
s
actions
in
designing
and
manufacturing
the
product
as
in
all
negligence
cases
the
manufacturer
can
be
found
liable
if
a
judge
or
jury
finds
that
the
manufacturer
failed
to
exercise
the
degree
of
care
that
a
reasonable
manufacturer
would
exercise
in
manufacturing
the
product
or
that
the
product
was
not
manufactured
according
to
the
manufacturer
s
own
specifications
under
this
theory
the
manufacturer
of
the
faulty
chair
might
be
liable
if
the
company
did
not
conduct
reasonable
inspections
to
ensure
that
products
were
checked
for
defects
before
being
sold
to
consumers
it
is
important
to
note
that
the
manufacturer
is
not
negligent
merely
for
failing
to
produce
a
perfectly
safe
product
illinois
courts
use
a
reasonable
care
balancing
test
that
asks
jurors
to
balance
the
likelihood
and
seriousness
of
harm
against
the
feasibility
and
burden
of
possible
precautions
that
might
have
avoided
the
harm
for
example
manufacturers
might
not
be
required
to
install
a
safety
feature
if
doing
so
would
make
the
product
prohibitively
expensive
or
impossible
to
use
in
these
cases
the
manufacturer
has
a
duty
to
warn
users
of
the
product
of
the
risks
associated
with
its
use
so
that
users
can
protect
themselves
this
is
why
ladders
for
example
have
so
many
warnings
on
them
no
ladder
can
be
made
perfectly
safe
so
manufacturers
warn
consumers
of
their
dangers
some
of
the
most
convincing
evidence
of
negligence
is
evidence
of
the
actions
of
other
manufacturers
of
similar
products
if
a
manufacturer
fails
to
take
precautions
or
to
provide
warnings
that
are
standard
in
the
industry
there
is
a
strong
likelihood
a
jury
will
find
that
the
manufacturer
was
negligent
breach
of
warranty
manufacturers
can
also
be
liable
for
product
injuries
caused
by
a
breach
of
warranty
breach
of
warranty
lawsuits
may
involve
the
uniform
commercial
code
ucc
which
is
a
bundle
of
statutes
adopted
in
illinois
and
other
states
to
govern
many
commercial
transactions
under
the
ucc
a
product
must
be
fit
for
its
intended
purpose
if
a
consumer
buys
a
product
and
is
hurt
while
using
it
for
a
purpose
for
which
it
is
clearly
intended
the
manufacturer
can
be
liable
a
product
must
also
be
fit
for
a
particular
purpose
for
which
the
seller
knows
the
buyer
is
purchasing
the
item
a
manufacturer
also
may
make
additional
warranties
to
the
consumer
the
breach
of
any
of
these
warranties
can
make
the
manufacturer
liable
to
consumers
hurt
by
the
product
in
some
situations
a
manufacturer
is
allowed
to
disclaim
some
of
these
warranties
so
a
plaintiff
must
check
to
determine
which
of
the
warranties
apply
general
accidents
and
injuries
a
broad
variety
of
accidents
and
injuries
may
lead
to
personal
injury
lawsuits
some
of
the
most
common
are
discussed
in
this
chapter
libel
and
slander
are
discussed
in
the
arts
entertainment
amp
intellectual
property
law
chapter
assault
and
battery
many
people
believe
that
assault
and
battery
are
one
action
they
are
actually
two
closely
related
but
distinct
actions
assault
is
the
attempt
or
threat
to
inflict
injury
on
another
person
when
coupled
with
the
apparent
ability
to
carry
out
the
attempt
or
threat
assault
does
not
require
actual
physical
contact
for
example
if
someone
threatens
to
strike
a
neighbor
and
appears
capable
of
carrying
out
the
threat
the
person
making
the
threat
may
be
liable
for
assault
even
though
he
or
she
never
touches
the
neighbor
battery
is
similar
to
assault
but
requires
actual
unwelcome
physical
contact
the
physical
contact
need
not
be
so
strong
as
to
injure
the
other
person
for
example
a
person
can
commit
battery
by
touching
another
person
in
an
unwelcome
sexual
manner
illegal
confinement
illegal
confinement
also
known
as
false
imprisonment
is
confinement
by
force
threats
of
force
or
physical
barriers
when
one
has
no
right
to
do
so
unlike
in
other
states
illinois
merchants
are
not
permitted
to
make
a
person
suspected
of
shoplifting
wait
against
his
or
her
wishes
for
the
police
to
arrive
if
the
merchant
keeps
the
suspect
longer
than
is
reasonable
or
necessary
under
the
circumstances
beyond
the
person
s
wishes
the
merchant
may
be
liable
for
illegal
confinement
landowner
liability
there
are
several
ways
a
landowner
may
be
liable
to
someone
injured
on
the
landowner
s
property
business
owners
and
home
owners
may
be
sued
if
they
do
something
wrong
that
causes
others
to
be
injured
on
their
property
a
business
owner
sometimes
is
sued
for
injuries
caused
by
people
committing
crimes
on
his
or
her
property
if
the
business
owner
did
not
take
appropriate
measures
to
ensure
the
safety
of
customers
an
example
of
this
type
of
case
occurs
when
a
person
is
attacked
in
a
parking
lot
and
then
sues
the
lot
s
owner
for
failing
to
provide
security
measures
that
could
have
prevented
the
attack
in
general
a
landowner
is
not
liable
for
the
injuries
of
a
trespasser
however
the
landowner
must
take
reasonable
care
to
protect
the
people
he
or
she
knows
come
on
the
property
for
legitimate
purposes
such
as
letter
carriers
a
landowner
may
be
responsible
to
children
injured
on
his
or
her
property
if
there
is
something
on
the
property
like
a
swimming
pool
that
is
dangerous
the
children
are
likely
to
exercise
less
care
than
adults
and
the
landowner
fails
to
exercise
sufficient
care
to
prevent
injury
to
a
reasonable
child
other
states
place
a
greater
liability
on
landowners
in
this
scenario
through
what
is
commonly
called
the
attractive
nuisance
doctrine
illinois
does
not
recognize
the
attractive
nuisance
theory
workers
compensation
illinois
workers
compensation
system
compensates
workers
for
injuries
occurring
in
the
workplace
without
a
workers
compensation
system
workers
injured
on
the
job
would
have
to
prove
that
their
employers
negligence
led
to
the
injury
because
the
system
does
not
require
proving
negligence
a
worker
injured
on
the
job
has
a
better
chance
of
being
compensated
than
if
he
or
she
is
injured
in
some
other
way
and
has
to
file
a
civil
lawsuit
instead
of
filing
suit
a
worker
notifies
her
employer
of
the
injury
and
the
employer
then
contacts
its
insurance
carrier
which
handles
payment
of
any
medical
bill
and
other
claims
made
by
the
employee
all
employers
subject
to
the
illinois
workers
compensation
act
must
either
carry
workers
compensation
insurance
or
demonstrate
they
have
the
financial
resources
to
cover
any
reasonably
anticipated
claims
the
trade
off
for
this
relatively
easy
route
to
compensation
is
a
limit
to
the
amount
of
money
that
can
be
awarded
for
a
work
related
injury
with
few
exceptions
employers
or
their
insurers
are
only
required
to
pay
for
medical
expenses
permanent
injuries
and
or
lost
wages
an
employer
cannot
be
made
to
pay
for
emotional
distress
such
as
pain
and
suffering
often
a
worker
contacts
an
attorney
because
the
employer
or
its
insurance
carrier
refuses
to
pay
a
workers
compensation
claim
maintaining
that
either
the
injury
was
not
work
related
or
that
the
benefits
demanded
exceed
those
justified
for
the
injury
sometimes
a
dispute
arises
after
an
employer
stops
making
workers
compensation
payments
when
disputes
arise
a
worker
has
a
variety
of
options
including
an
administrative
conference
small
claims
court
or
as
a
final
option
a
hearing
before
a
workers
compensation
judge
the
most
common
way
to
resolve
disputes
is
through
a
semi
formal
administrative
conference
subject
to
rules
established
by
the
illinois
department
of
labor
and
industry
at
the
conference
a
department
representative
acts
as
an
informal
mediator
and
referee
who
decides
what
kind
of
evidence
may
be
considered
by
those
attending
typically
the
employer
an
investigator
from
the
insurance
company
if
the
employer
is
not
self
insured
the
department
representative
the
injured
employee
and
the
employee
s
attorney
attend
the
conference
the
goal
of
a
conference
is
to
reach
a
voluntary
resolution
to
the
dispute
if
the
parties
cannot
resolve
their
dispute
the
department
representative
issues
a
judgment
that
everyone
is
obligated
to
follow
such
a
judgment
can
be
appealed
to
the
department
by
anyone
involved
in
the
conference
going
to
small
claims
court
is
another
way
to
resolve
disputes
over
a
workers
compensation
claim
both
the
employer
and
employee
however
must
agree
to
turn
over
the
dispute
to
a
conciliation
court
and
the
amount
of
the
dispute
cannot
exceed
either
party
can
decide
whether
to
be
represented
by
an
attorney
in
such
a
proceeding
finally
a
dispute
over
a
workers
compensation
claim
can
be
taken
to
a
special
workers
compensation
court
where
a
judge
will
formally
hear
evidence
about
the
injury
and
will
resolve
the
dispute
in
a
written
decision
that
both
sides
must
follow
anyone
disagreeing
with
the
decision
has
a
right
to
appeal
it
to
the
illinois
workers
compensation
court
of
appeals
and
if
still
unsatisfied
to
the
illinois
supreme
court
