penalty
page
welcome
to
the
irish
section
s
anti
death
penalty
page
amnesty
international
opposes
the
death
penalty
in
all
cases
and
without
reservation
the
time
has
come
the
time
has
come
to
abolish
the
death
penalty
world
wide
the
case
for
abolition
becomes
more
compelling
with
each
passing
year
nowhere
has
it
been
shown
that
the
death
penalty
has
any
special
power
to
reduce
crime
or
political
violence
in
country
after
country
it
is
used
disproportionately
against
the
poor
and
against
racial
and
ethnic
minorities
it
is
often
used
as
a
tool
of
political
repression
its
use
is
arbitrary
and
irrevocable
it
is
imposed
and
inflicted
arbitrarily
it
is
an
irrevocable
punishment
resulting
inevitably
in
the
execution
of
people
innocent
of
any
crime
it
is
a
violation
of
fundamental
human
rights
whatever
purpose
is
cited
the
idea
that
a
government
can
justify
a
punishment
as
cruel
as
death
conflicts
with
the
very
concept
of
human
rights
the
significance
of
human
rights
is
precisely
that
some
means
may
never
be
used
to
protect
society
because
their
use
violates
the
very
values
which
make
society
worth
protecting
there
are
states
in
the
us
which
have
the
death
penalty
along
with
the
us
government
and
the
us
military
as
part
of
the
irish
section
s
fight
against
the
death
penalty
there
are
four
local
groups
working
on
the
state
of
virginia
usa
these
are
group
dublin
the
limerick
group
the
schull
group
and
the
cork
group
and
now
for
some
information
on
virginia
and
its
very
strange
laws
virginia
currently
has
inmates
on
death
row
it
has
executed
inmates
since
five
of
them
in
another
two
have
been
executed
this
year
already
eleven
states
in
the
us
forbid
execution
of
the
mentally
retarded
virginia
is
not
one
of
them
the
methods
of
execution
in
va
are
lethal
injection
or
electrocution
by
choice
with
electrocution
by
default
the
contemporaneous
objection
rule
the
c
o
r
states
that
when
an
objection
is
not
raised
in
the
original
trial
it
cannot
be
considered
in
a
direct
or
later
appeal
every
state
except
virginia
waives
the
c
o
r
in
capital
cases
by
statute
or
by
case
law
this
rule
bars
appeals
courts
from
hearing
about
even
blatant
mistakes
in
the
trial
and
illegal
procedures
that
can
include
jury
selection
jury
instructions
evidence
prevented
or
withheld
witness
testimony
and
any
other
aspect
of
the
trial
these
problems
can
and
do
affect
the
basic
fairness
and
constitutionality
of
the
trial
the
issue
not
objected
to
at
the
first
trial
is
barred
even
if
it
shows
the
innocence
of
a
person
on
death
row
the
day
rule
the
day
rule
states
that
new
evidence
discovered
more
than
days
after
the
trial
cannot
be
considered
in
state
or
federal
courts
even
if
the
evidence
could
prove
the
innocence
of
a
convicted
defendant
the
day
rule
has
created
a
situation
where
a
person
can
be
legally
executed
despite
new
evidence
that
he
is
innocent
please
protest
against
this
continued
barbarism
