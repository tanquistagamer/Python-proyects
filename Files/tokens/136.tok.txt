of
it
s
type
in
the
world
then
a
major
industry
journal
published
a
study
showing
that
while
the
company
excelled
in
a
number
of
important
areas
it
had
virtually
no
image
of
community
service
the
client
was
especially
concerned
with
positive
public
recognition
at
that
time
as
they
were
about
to
go
public
and
the
owners
were
trying
to
pre
sell
blocks
of
stock
to
institutional
investors
the
company
had
regional
locations
representing
nearly
retail
outlets
in
states
they
needed
a
pr
program
that
would
work
well
from
coast
to
coast
to
save
costs
the
program
also
had
to
give
each
of
their
regional
administrators
the
tools
and
skills
needed
to
mount
their
own
local
media
public
relations
and
government
outreach
campaigns
experience

k
to
design
and
implement
a

local
marketing
programs
over
a
year
period
the
educational
outreach
marketing
segment
of
the
program
ran
from
to
and
provides
an
excellent
example
of
multiple
location
promotion
with
robots
results
the
client
set
clear
objectives
and
exceeded
them
in
the
program
s
first
year
the
client
donated
educational
programs
to
targeted
local
schools
taught
by
their
robot
mascots
by
the
program
s
conclusion
more
than
children
and
their
families
had
direct
contact
with
the
client
s
custom
robotic
mascots
and
promotional
materials
their
generous
support
of
local
education
was
amply
rewarded
the
client
s
ad
agency
media
counts
showed
that
the
robot
mascot
was
a
magnet
for
positive
media
coverage
the
media
return
alone
exceeded
the
client
s
first
year
program
costs
by
to
cnn
gave
the
client
international
coverage
with
a
minute

identified
the
client
and
prominently
featured
their
custom
robot
mascot
their
mascot
also
appeared
on
the
today
show
and
in
hundreds
of
local
media
spots
all
told
the
client
s
positive
media
coverage
nationwide
was
worth
more
than
much
of
it
in
front
page
feature
articles
principals
teachers
parents
and
children
sent
the
client
more
than
personal
letters
of
appreciation
perhaps
more
significant
were
the
letters
of
praise
sent
by
senators
congressional
representatives
governors
and
mayors
state
proclamations
applauding
the
client
s
contributions
were
passed

followed
by
dozens
of

a
special
white
house
ceremony
the
program
was
presented
a
presidential
