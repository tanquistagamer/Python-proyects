eight

they
hosed
me
with
cold
pressurised
water
they
pointed
the
water
jet
particularly
at
sensitive
areas
of
the
body
such
as
the
kidneys
genitals
and
rectum
they
lifted
me
up
so
that
my
whole
weight
hung
on
my
arms
while
hanging
in
the
air
they
gave
me
electric
shocks
through
my
fingers

of
my

human

defenders
in
turkey
are
under
intense
pressure
from
the
authorities
many
have
been
threatened
imprisoned
and
tortured
some
have
paid
for
their
commitment
to
human

with
their
lives
human

defenders
who
document
abuses
against
people
suspected
of
belonging
to
armed
groups
are
often
accused
of
supporting
these
groups
in
december
for
example
the
general
director
of
security
who
later
became
the
minister
of
justice
claimed
that
allegations
of
torture
were
only
made
with
the
aim
of
undermining
the
police
force
s
struggle
against
terrorism
such
statements
put
human
rights
defenders
at
even
greater
risk
for
decades
amnesty
international
has
documented
the
widespread
and
systematic
use
of
torture
and
ill
treatment
in
turkey
the
factors
which
contribute
to
this
gross
abuse
of
human
rights
remain
unchanged
principal
among
them
are
incommunicado
detention
the
failure
of
the
judicial
system
to
investigate
allegations
of
torture
and
the
almost
complete
impunity
enjoyed
by
members
of
the
security
forces
who
continue
to
be
protected
by
high
ranking
police
and
