a
overview
the
italian
market
for
pleasure
motorboats
including
inboard
in
outboard
and
pneumatic
boats
has
experienced
an
exceptional
growth
during
the
quinquennium
surging
two
and
a
half
times
its
sales
volume
in
italian
demand
for
pleasure
motorboats
reached
the
peak
of
its
high
development
phase
this
trend
was
even
more
accentuated
by
important
laws
issued
by
the
italian
parliament
which
somewhat
alleviated
tax
burdens
for
pleasure
motorboat
owners
after
this
period
of
astonishing
expansion
the
market
has
entered
a
new
cycle
characterized
by
stability
and
even
an
inflection
in
its
growth
rate
nonetheless
this
has
not
affected

imports
which
in
experienced
a
increase
in

current

and

approximately

the

in

u

continue
to

a

costs

and
thus
what

market
demand
in
europe
the
pleasure
boat
market
has
experienced
a
cyclic
growth
which
reached
in
the
peak
of
its
high
development
phase
this
trend
was
even
more
accentuated
on
the
italian
market
after
important
laws
issued
by
the
italian
parliament
in
which
contributed
to
further
boost
its
momentum
in
brief
the
inductive
type
of
personal
income
assessment
for
italian
resident
boat
owners
became
less
substantial
in
addition
the
value
added
tax
one
time
doubled
for
boats
over
tons
was
limited
to
boats
over
tons
approximately
meters
in
length
and
a
new
category
was
created
for
small
boat
owners
which
pay
a
reduced
vat
more
consistent
with
european
levels
thus
a
vat
was
applied
to
small
boats
under
ton
and
meters
and
kw
a
vat
applied
to
hulls
up
to
tons
and
a
vat
to
hulls
over
tons
it
is
understandable
how
these
laws
have
positively
influenced
the
growth
of
the
italian
domestic
pleasure
boat
market
which
chalked
up
an
amazing
increase
of
from
to
since
year
end
however
the
industry
has
been
experiencing
a
slightly
weaker
demand
for
pleasure
motorboats
several
factors
have
contributed
to
this
end
including
the
decline
in
the
overall
economy
with
slower
growth
of
personal
income
and
the
reluctance
of
pleasure
boat
consumers
to
take
on
additional
debt
skyrocketing
mooring
taxes
and
lack
of
an
adequate
infrastructure
to
support
pleasure
boating
a
pleasure
motorboat
is
by
far
a
discretionary
purchase
that
can
be
postponed
or
canceled
thus
when
the
overall
economy
weakens
the
demand
for
pleasure
boats
also
declines
the
introduction
of
outrageously
expensive
and
differentiated
annual
mooring
tax
rates
e
g
an
eight
meter
motorboat
currently
costs
approximately
instead
of
the
previous
heavily
contributed
to
dampen
consumer
purchases
many
observers
indicate
that
more
affordable
marinas
and
other
infrastructures
are
also
badly
needed
to
boost
medium
term
demand
nonetheless
u
s
products
strongly
desired
by
italian
dealers
and
distributors
because
of
their
innovations
special
features
and
very
competitive
prices
registered
a
further
increase
of
in
sales
to
italy
italian
demand
for
u
s
pleasure
motorboats
is
expected
to
fare
well
in
the
near
future
although
it
is
not
likely
to
reach
the
astonishing
increases
of
the
recent
past
end
user
profile
thirty
years
ago
there
was
one
boat
owner
in
italy
every
five
thousand
inhabitants
currently
there
is
one
boat
owner
every
hundred
the
future
could
perhaps
envision
one
boat
owner
every
italy
has
after
all
a
sea
faring
tradition
coupled
with
acceptable
weather
all
year
round
in
addition
the
market
should
benefit
from
the
fastest
growing
to
and
to
age
groups
the
latter
especially
are
reaching
the
maximum
wage
earning
period
allowing
them
to
consider
such
large
purchases
as
a
pleasure
boat
pleasure
motorboats
sold
in
italy
during
last
official
figure
available
amounted
to
units
for
inboard
in
outboard
pleasure
boats
units
for
outboard
pleasure
boats
and
for
pneumatic
boats
totaling
sales
for
million
close
to
the
same
amount
is
estimated
to
have
been
sold
in
with
a
increase
in
the
import
of
the
more
comfortable
medium
size
inboard
in
outboard
pleasure
boats
in
italian
demand
for
smaller
units
slightly
decreased
with
less
imports
of
pneumatic
boats
and
less
imports
of
outboard
models
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
the
small
motorboat
segment
is
still
by
far
the
most
popular
or
rather
the
more
affordable
diesel
engines
are
predominant
in
the
inboard
and
in
outboard
configurations
this
trend
generalized
all
over
europe
is
even
more
accentuated
in
italy
fuel
economy
cannot
be
considered
an
influencing
factor
due
to
low
amount
of
hours
per
year
of
navigation
for
a
pleasure
boat
the
dominant
criterior
is
the
safety
factor
for
the
same
reason
that
the
installation
of
two
independent
engines
has
become
a
standard
at
sea
gasoline
engine
powered
boats
thanks
to
the
increased
safety
factor
of
modern
designed
engines
are
also
increasing
their
small
market
share
and
find
favorable
application
in
prestige
high
performance
boats
where
high
speed
high
power
concentration
and
reduced
bulk
are
taken
as
major
design
criteria
outboard
engines
are
of
course
practically
all
gasoline
fueled
d
best
sales
prospects
since
a
pleasure
motorboat
is
considered
a
luxury
item
anyway
it
appears
that
the
sale
of
commodious
boats
such
as
medium
size
cabin
cruisers
and
the
more
popular
small
size
day
cruisers
to
meters
long
inboard
in
outboards
is
expected
to
keep
up
at
the
same
time
manufacturers
are
expected
to
continue
offering
smaller
units
both
for
logistical
and
economical
factors
to
appeal
to
new
boating
enthusiasts
entering
the
market
however
there
is
a
weak
request
at
the
moment
for
runabouts
regarding
the
engines
the
propeller
system
seems
to
be
still
the
most
popular
and
efficient
system
as
long
as
the
propeller
is
properly
designed
for
the
hull
and
engine
characteristics
waterjets
are
somewhat
increasing
their
penetration
both
in
the
small
and
high
power
segments
while
more
appropriate
for
larger
and
faster
boats
jet
propulsion
is
well
suited
to
small
boats
for
special
applications
such
as
coast
guard
fire
brigades
and
safe
approach
of
populated
beaches
where
efficiency
of
the
propulsion
system
is
of
secondary
importance
in
respect
to
safety
and
practical
factors
e
competitive
situation
domestic
production
the
italian
market
for
pleasure
motorboats
is
split
almost
fifty
fifty
among
foreign
and
domestic
suppliers
there
are
approximately
shipyards
in
italy
all
italian
of
which
about
cover
of
total
italian
sales
among
these
are
renowned
names
such
as
abbate
azimut
baglietto
rio
and
riva
the
remaining
are
small
artisan
type
enterprises
italian
shipyards
have
an
average
export
share
of
over
of
their
total
billing
but
in
the
high
prestige
segment
this
share
exceeds
with
some
shipyards
working
exclusively
for
the
export
market
high
technology
style
according
to
the
world
famous
italian
design
of
the
hull
line
and
vessel
interiors
are
the
main
reasons
for
achieving
a
high
share
of
this
market
where
price
competition
becomes
a
factor
of
secondary
importance
the
propulsion
systems
selected
by
italian
shipyards
for
powering
their
pleasure
boats
appear
very
international
italian
engine
manufacturers
are
present
all
along
the
line
with
diesel
and
gasoline
fueled
engines
successfully
exported
all
over
the
world
on
the
other
hand
italian
shipyards
select
the
engine
according
to
customer
and
boatbuilder
requirements
often
selecting
engines
imported
from
the
united
states
germany
sweden
etc
this
makes
import
export
figures
very
high
on
both
sides
italian
engines
used
by
italian
shipyards
are
mainly
inboard
engines
in
the
lower
power
bracket
both
diesel
and
gasoline
to
mention
just
a
few
iveco
aifo
bpm
while
in
the
medium
high
power
bracket
the
swedish
volvo
penta
and
the
american
detroit
diesel
and
caterpillar
have
the
highest
market
share
the
german
man
and
mtu
are
the
most
popular
for
engines
up
to
kw
and
above
used
on
luxury
yachts
in
the
italian

demand
increased
approximately
with
domestic
production
rising
from
previous
year
domestic
sales
surged
chalking
up
approximately
million
while
exports
rose
totaling
million
the
slight
inflection
in
the
market
demand
was
strongly
covered
by
foreign
producers
to
the
detriment
of
domestic
ones
whose
production
dropped

falling

in
they
reached
million
covering
half
of
the
italian
market
while
imports
rose
compared
to
previous
year
in
they
increased
which
is
still
obviously
remarkable
but
less
than
previous
year
due
to
the
slight
inflection
in
market
demand
and
to
the
fact
that
there
was
perhaps
a
readjustment
by
italian
boat
dealers
who
had
an
excess
supply
after
the
large
increases
of
the
past
in

are
really
beginning
to
fear
what

generally
looked
at
as
the

of

such
an

share
for
the

is
expected
to
keep
up
with
an
estimated
annual
real
growth
of
about
it
is
unlikely
however
that
it
will
be
able
to
repeat
the
amazing
performances
of
the
recent
past
in
the
short
term
in

of

with
the
consequent
drop

and
the
ability
to

as
well
as

are
the
winning
factors
for
selling

tend
to
represent
more
than
one
manufacturer
frequently
three
or
four
each
one
specialized
in
a
specific
product
segment
there
are
presently
approximately
distribution
outlets
in
italy
the
more
prestigious
yachts
are
sold
through
brokers
as
previously
stated
the
italian
government
recently
announced
that
only
italian
citizens
can
act
as
agents
for
signing
off
on
the
homologation
standards
compliance
documents
this
means
that
factory
personnel
of
non
italian
boat
manufacturers
imported
into
italy
cannot
sign
off
on
the
paperwork
quite
often
it
is
the
italian
dealers
or
distributors
who
signs
off
and
these
people
are
italian
citizens
however
if
the
manufacturer
terminates
the
italian
dealer
or
distributor
that
party
owns
the
homologation
and
may
charge
the
manufacturer
a
royalty
for
import
on
behalf
of
the
new
dealer
or
distributor
alternatively
the
manufacturer
can
go
through
the
expensive
homologation
procedure
anew
the
u
s
national
marine
manufacturers
associatin
nmma
has
made
a
ad
hoc
third
party
available
as
the
required
citizen
homologation
agent
for
any
nmma
boat
builder
who
can
act
on
behalf
of
multiple
boat
companies
meeting
their
requirements
of
italian
citizenship
for
the
agent
but
without
the
downside
difficulties
of
terminating
a
dealer
or
distributor
who
acts
as
homologation
agent
for

financing
payments
by
importers
are
usually
in
cash
or
in
maximum
days
with
a
letter
of
credit
it
is
very
difficult
to
establish
the
mark
up
imposed
by
local
distributors
importers
as
it
greatly
varies
depending
on
the
type
of
product
since
u
s
products
are
in
great
demand
because
of
their
competitive
consumer
prices
it
is
deemed
that
the
average
mark
up
is
not
very
high
and
that
dealers
prefer
to
rely
on
selling
large
quantities
