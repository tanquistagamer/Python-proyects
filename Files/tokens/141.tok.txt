what
do
robots
do
in
hospitals
years
ago
our
robot
was
visiting
patients
in
a
baltimore
hospital
one
young
girl
had
progeria
a
disease
that
causes
the
body
to
age
rapidly
this
year
old
patient
with
her
perfectly
normal
year
old
mind
was
trapped
in
the
wasting
body
of
an
year
old
the
staff
expected
her
to
die
within
weeks
which
she
knew
as
soon
as
she
saw
the
robot
she
became
quick
and
sassy
she
and
the
robot
had
a
great
time
joking
dancing
and
hugging
we
never
forgot
her
smile
her
laughter
or
our
special
friendship
this
program
is
the
result
we
don
t
have
a
miracle
cure
for
children
s
bodies
but
we
do
have
powerful
healing
lessons
for
their
minds
and
an
amazingly
effective
way
to
teach
children
naturally
project
themselves
onto
ep
robots
girls
and
boys
young
and
old
black
white
brown
and
yellow
in
the
blink
of
an
eye
a
robot
can
become
a
child
s
personal
buddy
who
s
cheering
just
for
them
a
robot
has
another
special
quality
in
hospitals
it
only
projects
love
hope
humor
and
positive
emotions
a
robot
won
t
change
its
expression
or
look
away
when
it
meets
a
burn
victim
a
robot
doesn
t
stare
with
pity
or
depression
when
meeting
a
child
in
chemotherapy
who
will
die
within
a
few
months
we
use
our
robots
to
project
love
and
strength
to
tell
jokes
to
accept
the
children
as
they
are
to
inspire
them
to
believe
in
themselves
and
to
teach
kids
how
to
give
life
their
best
shot
while
humans
often
look
at
life
support
systems
and
wheelchairs
with
apprehension
robots
look
with
familiarity
or
even
envy
they
show
children
that
these
life
saving
machines
that
make
them
so
different
are
actually
prized
possessions
stuff
to
be
proud
of
an
eeg
becomes
child
s
personal
video
game
and
wheelchairs
over
the
years
our
robots
have
conducted
as
many
wheelchair
races
as
the
special
olympics
and
the
funny
thing
is
the
kids
always
win
just
by
a
hair
we
use
robots
to
give
children
a
fresh
positive
look
at
themselves
taught
with
warmth
and
energy
these
high
tech
characters
are
also
high
touch
they
motivate
with
love
and
laughter
and
they
engage
children
in
a
very
different
way
from
adults
the
robot
lessons
always
look
at
the
brighter
side
of
life
and
leave
each
children
with
lasting
positive
memories
we
use
this
rapport
to
teach
children
a
special
group
of
skills
we
call
super
powers
what
is
the
super
power
tour
the
super
power
tour
is
a
traveling
educational
program
that

face
of
difficult
circumstances
the
spt
program
objectives
are
to
bring
joy

laughter
to
kids

it
most

pain
loneliness

sadness
that
young

fall
into
to
teach
practical
skills
that
enable
children

confront
their
challenges

improve
their
moods

five
techniques
in
all
each
power
is
a

promotes
a
positive
mental
attitude
easy
exercises
with
muscle
tone
breathing
and
smiling
make
a
huge
difference
in
energy
and
feelings
the
robot
s
lessons
in

power
teach
exactly

the
power
of
words

teaching
a

something
