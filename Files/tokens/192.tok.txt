the

wants
to
see
more
one
of
the
areas

our
concern

the
freedom

the

josh
friedman
who
wrote
the
report
s
introductory
essay
based
on
more
than
interviews
with
government
officials
journalists
and
other

the
report
demonstrates
how
independent
journalists
are
regularly
harassed
censored
and
jailed
under
the
provisions
of
a
restrictive
press
law
enacted
in
the
repressive
climate

said

we
look
forward
to
the
time
when
