the

reached
heights
of
more

a

the
kamchatka
volcanoes
are
among
the
most
active

zone
sits

where
the
pacific
plate
is
sinking
beneath
the
northeast

of
the
eurasian

the

crew
obtained
dramatic
video
and
photographic
images
of
this
region
during
the
eruption
which
will
assist
scientists
in
analyzing
the
dynamics
of
the
recent

the

in

were
obtained
using
the
following
radar
channels
red

the

included
massive
ejections

reached
altitudes

mixed
with
volcanic
ash
triggered
mudflows
on

paths
of
