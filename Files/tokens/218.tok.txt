biomass
is
the
amount
of
plant
material
on
an
area
of
earth
s
surface
radar
can
directly
sense
the
quantity
and
organizational
structure
of
the
woody
biomass
in
the
forest
science
team
members
at
the
university
of
michigan
used
the
radar
data
to
estimate
the
standing
biomass
for
this
raco
site
in
the
upper
peninsula
of
michigan
detailed
surveys
of
forest
stands
will
be
used
to
assess
the
accuracy
of
these
techniques
the
seasonal
growth
of
terrestrial
plants
and
forests
in
particular
leads
to
the
temporary
storage
of
large
amounts
of
carbon
which
could
directly
affect
changes
in
global
climate
in
order
to
accurately
predict
future
global
change
scientists
need
detailed
information
about
current
distribution
of
vegetation
types
and
the
amount
of
biomass
present
around
the
globe
optical
techniques
to
determine
net
biomass
are
frustrated
by
chronic
cloud
cover
imaging
radar
can
penetrate
through
cloud
cover
with
negligible
signal
losses
