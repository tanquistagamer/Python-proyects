an
oasis
of
green
shuttered
calm
a
city
of
enchanting
lakes
and
crumbling
french
architecture
the
refined
older
sister
to
an
explosive
young
ho
chi
minh
city
these
are
some
of
the
images
of
hanoi
trotted
out
by
vietnam
guidebooks
you
should
not
believe
it
from
the
vantage
point
of
a
cyclo
rickshaw
tour
through
hanoi
s
ancient
quarters
it
was
clear
to
me
that
vietnam
s
capital
is
anything
but
peaceful
life
is
lived
out
at
full
throttle
as
motorcycles
seem
to
hoot
their
way
not
just
around
you
but
over
and
under
you
in
their
impatience
to
get
on
with
life
i
had
insisted
we
travel
only
by
the
ubiquitous
cyclo
still
a
leading
form
of
transport
outside
hanoi
and
ho
chi
minh
city
but
i
hadn
t
bargained
for
the
aftermath
of
typhoons
frankie
and
nicki
which
left
me
knee
deep
in
water
before
i
had
even
reached
the
rendezvous
when
i
finally
arrived
my
guide
mr
hieu
was
all
smiles
and
so
was
i
when
i
found
he
had
lined
up
a
car
as
well
as
a
couple
of
cyclos
for
us
first
stop
for
visitors
to
hanoi
is
usually
the
ho
chi
minh
mausoleum
a
fascinating
if
somewhat
eerie
monument
housing
the
embalmed
body
of
the
former
leader
affectionately
known
as
uncle
ho
it
was
thursday
and
the
mausoleum
was
closed
we
headed
instead
to
the
modernist
russian
built
ho
chi
minh
museum
for
a
quick
tour
of
the
former
leader
s
life
the
exhibits
are
interesting
but
the
english
language
is
scarce
so
a
guide
is
much
needed
next
stop
was
the
one
pillar
pagoda
where
we
interrupted
preparations
for
a
ceremony
honouring
a
leading
monk
who
had
recently
died
later
we
saw
the
charming
tran
quoc
pagoda
overlooking
west
lake
and
the
white
horse
pagoda
where
a
white
bearded
monk
talked
about
travel
writer
barbara
cohen
hanoi
s
french
quarter
walled
colonial
villas
in
wide
tree
lined
boulevards
was
seen
from
the
comfort
of
the
car
en
route
to
the
temple
of
literature
an
th
century
centre
of
learning
where
mr
hieu
pointed
out
the
faint
etchings
on
stone
tablets
that
list
each
year
s
three
most
outstanding
scholars
we
were
plunged
from
this
scene
of
erudition
into
living
hanoi
a
few
minutes
later
as
we
eased
ourselves
in
cyclos
and
bumped
and
swerved
our
way
around
the
water
tower
past
half
hidden
pagodas
and
through
the
narrow
streets
that
make
up
the
old
quarter
silk
street
herb
street
steel
street
and
flower
street
silk
street
is
the
heart
of
hanoi
s
tourist
district
and
according
to
mr
hieu
the
owners
of
the
yellow
and
green
shophouses
are
prosperous
enough
to
own
a
second
family
home
in
other
areas
of
hanoi
where
space
and
water
are
in
better
supply
beyond
silk
street
however
and
we
were
passing
family
rattan
factories
and
wizened
old
women
with
blackened
teeth
selling
obscure
cigarettes
for
a
few
cents
each
proprietors
here
have
not
fared
as
well
life
is
traditional
fascinating
and
raw
this
part

they

fit

trying

promote

a

cultural
tourism
is
the
buzzword
in
industry
circles
and
although
definitions
are
understandably
soft
it
is
perceived
as
educational
relatively
environmentally
friendly
and
non
intrusive
for
the
host
country
more
importantly
it
addresses
growing
concerns
shared
by
other
emerging
destinations
about
the
possible
loss
of
vietnam
s
cultural
identity
in
the
face
of
increasing
numbers
of
foreign
visitors
touring
more
diverse
destinations
explained
mr
do
quang
trung
chairman
of
the
vnat
we
are
trying
to
preserve
our
cultural
and
ecological
environment
and
at
the
same
time
promote
tourism
which
is
a
difficult
task
i
think
we
need
to
focus
more
on
introducing
our
culture
to
foreign
visitors
for
this
the
idea
of
cultural
tourism
is
not
new
and
vietnamese
tour
operators
are
fired
up
by
the
idea
of
boosting
cultural
interest
said
mr
nguyen
van
nhi
general
director
of
vietnamtourism
ho
chi
minh
city
we
need
to
learn
from
other
countries
on
how
to
preserve
the
unique
features
of
our
country
we
also
need
to
create
a
more
interesting
product
for
tourists
take
them
into
the
rural
countryside
fruit
gardens
and
pottery
villages
or
maybe
take
them
into
small
family
homes
so
they
can
see
what
a
family
altar
is
like
rather
than
just
be
told
basically
we
need
to
increase
the
cultural
interest
of
tours
in
vietnam
not
just
in
obvious
ways
culture
influences
so
much
down
to
the
way
we
arrange
our
belongings
in
our
houses
we
need
to
create
a
specifically
vietnamese
product
that
is
to
do
with
history
and
culture
i
believe
that
this
is
what
people
really
want
vietnamese
for
example
are
very
interested
in
american
culture
and
i
am
sure
it
works
the
other
way
too
the
new
emphasis
on
culture
both
popular
and
refined
is
making
its
way
into
tour
programmes
with
saigontourist
now
incorporating
farm
visits
in
its
mekong
delta
tours
conservationists
in
the
former
imperial
capital
of
hue
are
planning
authentic
arts
performances
in
the
former
royal
theatre
when
restoration
work
is
finished
next
year
it
is
also
matched
by
a
national
enthusiasm
for
architectural
conservation
that
is
applauded
by
most
but
has
caused
havoc
for
developers
in

opportunities

veteran

s
cruise

mr

who
joined

of
hong

in

this
year
as
general
manager
is
deputy
chairman
of
the
travel
industry
council
of
hong

while
he
has
an
interest
in
promoting
the
products
of
his
own
company
he
has
a
broad
perspective
on
the
cruise
industry
having
served
on
the
boards
of
a
string
of
travel
trade
associations
watertours
of
hong

the
largest
of
the
local
cruise
tour
operators
handled
about
passengers
last
year
mr
tsang
predicts
a
modest
to
per
cent
increase
in
the
business
in
the
next
few
years
but
growth
he
believes
will
be
contingent
on
the
government
s
willingness
to
improve
and
increase
the
number
of
berthing
facilities
right
now
part
of
the
harbour
is
a
bit
discouraging
because
of
the
choppy
waters
caused
by
high
speed
water
traffic
he
said
there
is
no
real
concern
by
the
government
for
those
who
love
boating
with
many
people
trying
to
board
private
and
corporate
vessels
at
the
same
time
the
tour
operators
are
loading
at
queen
s
pier
and
the
kowloon
public
pier
the
situation
is
jammed
the
hong
kong
tourist
association
hkta
among
others
is
advocating
that
a
new
international
passenger
terminal
be
built
perhaps
at
the
present
kai
tak
site
mr
tsang
would
like
to
see
this
also
used
as
a
boarding
place
for
local
boating
he
has
recommended
to
the
government
that
other
new
boarding
areas
for
pleasure
junks
and
tour
operators
be
located
in
different
parts
of
hong
kong
closer
to
where
people
live
such
as
at
tun
mun
or
kwun
tong
his
interest
is
not
just
in
the
overseas
market
but
also
local
residents
partly
because
the
expanding
market
of
visitors
from
china
rely
on
hong
kong
relatives
to
guide
and
accompany
them
on
local
sight
seeing
tours
boarding
points
have
to
be
conveniently
located
and
tours
suitably
priced
and
promoted
for
local
people
to
think
of
taking
their
china
relatives
on
a
trip
mr
tsang
wants
to
see
tours
such
as
those
to
lei
yue
mun
and
lamma
island
marketed
to
asian
visitors
not
only
as
a
seafood
eating
opportunity
but
also
as
a
chance
to
worship
at
the
old
temples
in
the
area
on
lamma
he
sees
there
are
opportunities
for
chinese
and
other
visitors
to
have
a
drink
in
the
bars
with
the
established
expatriate
community
to
talk
to
them
and
find
out
why
they
enjoy
the
simpler
style
of
life
they
have
chosen
in
hong
kong
mr
tsang
notes
that
the
water
cruise
business
has
adapted
over
the
years
to
accommodate
the
different
interests
of
tourists
as
the
market
changes
and
grows
more
sophisticated
in
recent
years
asians
have
dominated
the
market
many
especially
young
asians
are
western
educated
and
are
interested
in
the
cultural
and
historical
side
of
hong
kong
they
are
interested
in
seeing
po
lin
monastery
on
lantau
the
elderly
don
t
tend
to
have
this
interest
they
want
to
concentrate
on
shopping
but
younger
japanese
malaysians
and
singaporeans
in
particular
want
to
do
what
the
european
tourists
do
they
are
likely
to
have
afternoon
tea
at
the

and
travel
on

first
thing
most

see
as
their

swings
over

is
the
giant

on

most
see
no
more
of

or
lantau
but
those
who
take
the
time
to
explore
this
island
and
stay
longer
than
the
standard
organised
day
tour
are
generally
rewarded
with
an
experience
of
hong

beyond

lantau
is

most
of

more
than

study
vistour
which
outlines
the
nto
s

for
the
future
of

in
the
hong

special
administrative
region
recommends
the
south
west
part
of

be
officially
classified
as
leisure
island
the
study
recognises
the
appeal
of
the
island
s
mountain
scenery
attractive
coastal
areas
and
its
open
environment
it
also
notes
that
accessibility
to
lantau
is
about
to
be
radically
altered
by
the
creation
of
new
infrastructure
serving
the
airport
on
its
north

which
will
link
the
island
by
rail
and

to

fortunately
for
lantau
and
the
quality
of

of
hong

residents
who
enjoy
the
island
on

the
hkta
does
not
recommend
all
out
tourist
development
it
recognises
that
there
is
a
fine
line
between
giving
the
greatest
number
of
people
access
to
the
island
and
retaining
the
tranquil
green
environment
which
is
central
to
the
island
s
appeal
plans
for
the
island
include
a
cable
car
link
between
the
township
of
tung
chung
formerly
a
small
remote
fishing
village
on
the
north
side
of
the
island
which
has
grown
in
the
past
couple
of
years
into
a
thriving
settlement
servicing
the
airport
construction
teams
to
ngong
ping
lantau
peak
the
project
which
would
be
relatively
inoffensive
to
the
natural
environment
would
enable
easier
access
to
the
giant
buddha
and
the
surrounding
country
park
trails
the
government
says
it
will
not
develop
the
present
one
lane
road
connecting
tung
chung
with
the
southern
part
of
the
island
the
hkta
notes
the
increased
number
of
people
likely
to
use
lantau
s
country
parks
and
landscape
protection
areas
would
need
to
be
monitored
any
new
development
would
need
to
be
very
carefully
considered
and
sited
the
vistour
study
said
nonetheless
the
hkta
does
propose
a
resort
style
hotel
near
po
lin
monastery
possibly
in
conjunction
with
a
golf
course
at
tung

it
is
worth
discovering

with
its
ancient
forts
old
fishing
villages
and
serene
hillsides
before
the

is
completed
due

whatever
changes
are
due
to
take
place
well
thought
out

the
convergence
of

way

cautions
mr

chief

organisation

the
costs
to
air
carriers
of
using
a
crs
as
a
distribution
channel
have
come
into
the
limelight
recently
cost
levels
are
increasing
and
new
forms
of
charges
such
as
cancellation
fees
have
arisen
due
to
the
economic
undercurrents
airlines
hotels
and
other
travel
service
companies
will
choose
to
have
fewer
travel
agents
pay
less
commissions
and
move
towards
greater
direct
sales
through
various
automation
options
technology
is
increasing
the
capability
for
leaving
the
travel
agent
and
even
the
crs
out
of
the
distribution
chain
entirely
mr
lyle
said
for
example
the
method
of
selling
airline
tickets
through
a
crs
or
on
line
service
is
changing
airlines
such
as
lufthansa
which
is
using
cd
roms
and
alitalia
british
airways
usair
continental
delta
northwest
swissair
and
united
which
use
diskettes
are
either
giving
access
to
a
crs
via
an
airline
server
or
direct
access
to
the
airline
s
individual
reservation
system
on
the
hotel
side
hilton
is
now
distributing
cd
roms
to
facilitate
internet
booking
next
you
have
the
recent
substantive
entrances
into
marketing
through
world
wide
web
sites
on
the
internet
as
well
as
by
many
other
travel
services
currently
more
than
major
airlines
from
countries
have
web
sites
further
us
based
airlines
have
responded
to
the
economic
undercurrents
by
placing
a
commission
cap
on
domestic
fares
said
mr
lyle
after
considerable
initial
fuss
the
concept
now
seems
to
have
taken
a
firm
foothold
in
the
us
the
first
year
of
the
cap
is
reported
to
have
produced
an
improvement
in
the
bottom
line
of
us
airlines
to
the
tune
of
about
us
million
no
significant
change
in
market
share
between
airlines
imposing
the
cap
and
other
airlines
and
a
significant
but
not
earth
shattering
increase
in
the
number
of
closings
of
travel
agents
not
surprisingly
therefore
airlines
outside
the
us
are
considering
similar
action
more
than
one
european
airline
is
reducing
overrides
and
incentive
payments
lufthansa
has
already
announced
it
will
be
reducing
basic
levels
of
commission
where
electronic
ticketing
is
concerned
sas
has
effectively
reduced
commission
via
the
sas
travel
plan
a
form
of
electronic
season
pass
and
start
up
carrier
easyjet
in
europe
appears
to
be
taking
the
valujet
approach
to
commissions
that
is
avoiding
them
if
possible
another
quirk
in
the
commission
structure
is
that
at
least
one
airline
in
the
us
is
now
offering
a
bigger
commission
for
booking
outside
a
crs
than
when
using
a
crs
while
the
crs
will
stay
in
a
focal
role
for
some
time
mr
lyle
believes
there
will
be
a
greater
use
of
other
travel
distribution
channels
that
are
now
becoming
available
along
with
greater
interaction
amongst
these
channels
one
particular
benefit
of
the
evolution
of
new
distribution
channels
notably
the
internet
has
been
to
sharpen
the
competitive
edge
of
the
incumbents
and
the
crs
are
we
seeing
the
beginning
of
the
end
of
the
travel
agent
mr
lyle
thinks
this
seems
unlikely
first
travel
agents
provide
a
much
broader
and
often
much
more
personalised
service
to
passengers
than
the
airlines
do
directly
they
are
not
tied
to
an
individual
supplier
and
offer
expert
and
hopefully
impartial
advice
on
different
carriers
fares
and
routings
different
hotels
and
different
car
hire
companies
just
to
name
a
few
products
and
agents
can
themselves
offer
benefits
for
example
a
franchising
chain
already
has
a
frequent
traveller
award
programme
second
sonic
travel
agency
chains
have
major
purchasing
power
and
are
able
to
negotiate
private
fares
with
the
airlines
passing
on
at
least
some
of
the
savings
to
their
clients
they
are
acting
as
consolidators
as
well
as
agents
thus
there
is
no
reason
why
a
travel
agent
cannot
make
greater
use
of
the
internet
to
serve
these
clients
consequently
while
there
is
likely
to
be
some
sort
of
shake
out
coupled
with
more
intensive
consolidation
into
consortia
or
franchising
networks
travel
agents
appear
to
be
here
to
stay
because
of
the
value
added
services
they
provide
however
the
surviving
agent
will
be
aggressively
automated
in
a
niche
market
or
part
of
a
chain
and
most
importantly
client
driven

north

at

conference
on

were
told
asian
markets
are
complex
and
the
us
faces
competition
with
attractive
asian
destinations
in
his
marketing
segmentation
in
asia
presentation
mr
brian
deeson
president
and
ceo
of
century
international
hotels
in
hong
kong
selected
five
lesser
known
asian
countries
including
india
korea
singapore
thailand
and
taiwan
to
highlight
as
examples
of
complexity
he
said
travel
patterns
are
like
ripples
on
a
pond
people
tend
to
travel
firstly
within
a
very
small
radius
from
their
own
home
and
then
to
increasingly
remoter
destinations
as
their
sophistication
and
spending
capability
increases
this
means
that
by
the
time
an
asian
traveller
hits
north
america
he
or
she
has
probably
already
had
several
trips
within
asia
and
therefore
in
relative
terms
is
quite
a
sophisticated
traveller
on
india
a
vast
country
frequently
overlooked
by
its
asian
neighbours
mr
deeson
noted
there
are
an
estimated
million
indians
who
could
be
classified
as
middleclass
and
thus
have
the
ability
to
travel
outside
the
country
as
their
lifestyles
improve
the
market
potential
is
therefore
enormous
indian
expenditure
first
goes
to
appliances
then
cars
and
thirdly
travel
he
said
adding
that
the
greatest
hindrance
to
increased
overseas
travel
has
been
a
lack
of
international
connections
mr
deeson
was
upbeat
on
the
recommencement
of
around
the
world
flights
by
united
airlines
taking
in
delhi
on
a
daily
basis
and
thus
linking
it
to

and
north

via
hong
kong
on
the
korean
market
one
of
north
america
s
most
important
in

mr
deeson
said
overseas
travel
is
fashionable
and
the
desire
and
means
for
such
a
leisure
activity
is
spread
throughout
the
country
prospects
for
growth
are
good
the
forecast
for
departures
varied
from
to
million
and
double
digit
growth
per
year
will
be
sustained
until
the
year
travel
remains
dominated
by
group
tours
korea
is
only
what

termed
flirting

travel
he
said
growth
from
singapore
which
on
a
per

basis
has
the
highest
number
of
travellers
in
the
world
is
expected
to
reach
a
plateau
by
the
turn
of
the
century
due
to
its
small
population
from
to
the
number
of

to

grew
marginally
from

the

not

also

the

will

on

before
tourism
canada
was
a
pata

people
didn
t
think
canada
belonged
to
the
pacific
rim
but
with
pata
there
s
a
sense
of
belonging
mr
ng
told
ttg
asia
asians
think
canada
is
cold
in
the
north
pole
but
when
with
pata
they
think
it
s
part
of
the
pacific
it
s
easier
to
sell
representatives
of
two
other
canadian
based
travel
companies
believed
tourism
canada
paid
so
little
attention
to
asian
markets
that
the
move
will
have
virtually
no
impact
the
influence
will
not
be
that
crucial
as
far
as
the
asia
pacific
market
is
concerned
because
most
canadian
operators
have
their
own
connections
and
do
their
own
sales
trips

malaysian

she
said

agreed
even

we

those

don

ms

her

would
be
interested
in
cancun
in

and
new

normally
people
stay
on

so
it
s
good
to

although
she
had
spoken
with
several

ms

was
not
looking
for

as
she
brought
in
only
two
to
three
groups
to

per

and
had
a

to

all

noted

the

although
the

some
of

ms

told

the

needed

look

singaporeans
going
for
eco
tours
from

september
by
natalie
chen
singapore
more
singaporeans
are
opting
for
eco
adventure
tours
with
the
market
for
such
holidays
ready
to
jump
by
per
cent
this
year
said
mr
chang
theng
hwee
managing
director
of
country
holidays
travel
he
estimated
the
niche
market
was
still
relatively
small
making
up
less
than
five
per
cent
of
the
singaporean
outbound
market
but
the
singaporean
market
for
eco
adventure
tours
is
the
largest
in
south
east
asia
due
to
the
population
s
environmental
awareness
there
are
even
less
operators
in
this
line
which
allows
for
our
growth
in
the
local
market
said
mr
chang
mr
benny
ng
assistant
tour
manager
of
country
holidays
travel
said
the
hip
to
be
green
trend
has
contributed
to
the
popularity
of
tours
most
of
our
clients
like
to
know
that
their
dollars
are
helping
to
save
the
environment
and
the
local
indigenous
population
he
said
mr
chang
said
eco
adventure
tours
are
a
few
hundred
dollars
more
expensive
than
standard
packages
popular
extras
include
visiting
a
private
game
park
and
having
meals
prepared
by
their
own
cooks
the
idea
of
exclusiveness
and
hygiene
appeal
to
consumers
tastes
and
they
are
prepared
to
pay
for
quality
mr
ng
said
for
eco
adventure
tours
you
can
t
be
cheap
because
it
affects
the
quality
and
aim
of
such
travel
mr
chang
said
a
key
reason
for
growth
was
that
clients
belonged
to
the
upmarket
category
even
with
the
economic
slowdown
we
are
not
affected
because
our
clients
can
afford
the
tours
but
he
said
the
danger
of
eco
adventure
tours
lay
in
the
abuse
of
the
term
he
said
anyone
can
organise
an
eco
adventure
tour
but
they
may
not
carry
out
environmentally
friendly
practices
he
cited
trekkers
to
the
himalayas
who
used
firewood
instead
of
kerosene
hence
contributing
to
deforestation

once

it

laos
tragic
loss
a
lesson
for
industry
from
travel
trade
gazette
asia
september
the
death
of
claude
vincent
serves
as
a
grim
reminder
of
the
potential
pitfalls
of
travelling
in
the
emerging
tourism
markets
of
former
indochina
a
dangerous
cocktail
of
war
weaponry
and
poverty
in
laos
contributed
to
this
senseless
act
of
violence
that
cost
mr
vincent
his
life
this
is
a
scenario
that
has
played
itself
all
to
often
in
cambodia
vietnam
myanmar
and
at
times
even
thailand
we
are
often
reminded
that
this
can
easily
happen
in
new
york
or
in
europe
and
cases
of
asian
visitors
slain
on
trips
to
north
america
are
not
unknown
but
that
knowledge
does
little
to
soften
the
loss
few
foreigners
in
laos
or
in
other
countries
in
the
region
have
done
more
for
their
adopted
country
than
mr
vincent
he
was
fond
of
saying
that
laos
was
his
country
his
people
and
he
worked
with
a
passion
that
showed
his
commitment
to
his
adopted
land
after
moving
to
laos
he
was
one
of
only
five
or
six
expatriates
who
stayed
on
after
the
liberation
of
vientiane
in
having
started
a
tour
company
in
the
early
s
he
continued
to
operate
tours
for
visiting
dignitaries
heading
to
vietnam
until
a
vietnamese
embassy
opened
in
from
untill
he
worked
in
trading
coffee
and
in
the
transportation
industry
which
opened
his
eyes
to
the
beauty
of
southern
laos
where
several
of
sodetour
s
lodges
are
located
after
returning
to
tourism
with
the
lao
national
tourism
company
in
mr
vincent
started
sodetour
in
and
the
network
of
lodges
soon
followed
he
was
active
in
forming
the
tourism
development
coalition
in
and
was
well
know
in
the
foreign
community
as
a
liaison
between
laotians
and
westerners
this
sad
event
should
make
the
industry
as
a
whole
pause
for
thought
as
operators
rush
into
expanding
markets
concerns
over
people
s
safety
and
security
should
never
exceed
the
need
to
buy
and
sell
travel
his
passing
also
serves
as
a
reminder
of
the
dangers
of
tourism
expanding
faster
than
the
infrastructure
and
national
development
in
countries
around
the
region

hong

travel

to
raising

too
high

major

airlines
and
travel
agents
are
waiting
on
the
airport
authority
to
announce
the
cost
structure
for
landing
and
other
fees
at
chek

p
o
manager
ms
irene
law
said
she
understood
there
should
be
a
premium
for
using
a
new
airport
such
as
chek
lap
kok
ms
law
said
although
we
have
heard
about
the
expected
increased
rates
for
the
new
airport
it
is
still
too
early
to
say
how
much
airfares
would
be
hiked
the
question
we
ask
is
to
what
extent
mr
terence
wong
manager
of
hong
thai
citizens
travel
services
said
travel
agents
would
not
worry
about
hiked
rates
he
said
air
fares
would
not
be
able
to
climb
too
high
as
there
would
be
heightened
competition
as
more
airlines
used
the
new
airport
another
industry
source
believed
that
airlines
had
inherent
structures
to
provide
leeway
for
such
increases
airlines
will
have
to
do
cost
altering
in
other
aspects
of
their
operations
to
balance
off
the
increase
so
that
it
will
not
cause
air
fare
hikes
which
are
too
high
he
said
he
believed
that
hong
kong
s
airport
would
continue
to
be
strategic
for
airlines
compared
to
neighbouring
airports
in
china
and
macau
various
asian
airlines
want
to
see
at

kok
orient

association
the
major
regional
representative
airline
body
warned
of
the
detrimental
effects
the
hiked
rates
would
have
on
airlines
and
travellers
mr
richard
stirland
director
general
of
the
association
said
the
news
was
extremely
disturbing
for
airlines
and
bad
news
for
travellers
mr
stirland
expected
a
negative
impact
on
tourism
and
trade
to
be
the
result
he
said
it
was
idle
to
assume
airlines
could
simply
absorb
such
an
increase
without
either
passing
it
on
to
passengers
through
higher
fares
or
re

mr

he

of

triple

waived
in
koreans
visited
hawaii
however
mr
paul
linneman
information
officer
at
the

embassy
in

said
the
law
states
clearly
that
a
waiver
can
only
be
considered
if
the
rate
of
visa
refusals
for
a
country
is
less
than
two
per

currently
between
five
and
seven
per

of

applicants
are
refused

this
clearly
falls

there

always
be
an

for

in

don

he

for

the

it

mr

regional
director

general

of

encouraged
travel

to
embrace
these
technological
advancements
as
they
would
come
fast

slick
most

cannot
handle
the
complex
fare

won

really
have
access
to
all
the
comparative
airline
fares
and

he
said
going
on
the

he
said
would
only
serve
to
highlight
the
travel
agent
s
role
as
consultant
and
custodian
of
the
client
it
would
only
be
a
threat
if
travel
agents
become
complacent
and
fail
to
face
up
to
technology
said
mr

ms
ridy
suen
leisure
travel
manager
for
thomas
cook
said
that
the
internet
could
be
turned
into
an
advantage
for
the
agent
on
our
part
we
have
begun
packaging
holiday
destinations
which
include
air
fare
accommodations
and
other
services
and
made
them
available
on
our
web
site
and
the
response
has
been
very
good
but
mr
david
ho
managing
director
of
sime
travel
in
singapore
said
whether
it
is
klm
or
any
other
airline
the
moment
it
infiltrates
into
customer
fares
it
will
affect
agents
but
those
who
need
other
services
will
still
go
to
agents
mr
james
reinnoldt
northwest
regional
managing

said
in

airlines
find

only
issues

for

by
per

and

for
a

sources
contend
there
is
nothing
on

horizon
they
do
not

action
as
the
present
airport
was
built
with
per

foreign
aid
the
travel
trade
says
pollution
and
lack
of
planning
is
leading
to
the
decline

nepal
s
tourism
lufthansa
the
only
european
carrier
flying
directly
to
kathmandu
has
explained
why
it
is
almost

to
withdraw
from

low
yields
the
end
of
double
digit
tourism
growth
and
difficulties
with
the
location
of
its
international
airport
are
being
cited
as
main
reasons
lufthansa
flew
more
than
passengers
last
year
into
nepal
but
the
airline
s
board
is
expected
to
decide
for
a
stop
in
operations
following
lufthansa
s
directive
to
german
tour
operators
that
the

will
not
accept

mr

flew

country
to

mr
sethi
said
the
board
is
reviewing
the
viability
of
the
route
as
part
of
an
overall
exercise
to
ensure
permanent
competitiveness
for
the
lufthansa
product
the
unique
location
of
kathmandu
airport
in
a
valley
with
a
m
runway
instead
of
the
conventional
m
is
being
cited
by
lufthansa
as
a
reason
for
a
cut
in
profits
most
aircraft
flying
into
kathmandu
are
twin
engined
to
ensure
safety
in
case
of
engine
failure
during
take
off
either
passenger
or
fuel
load
has
to
be
reduced
except
for
nearby
based
thai
airways
international
all
carriers
stop
en
route
to
refuel
mr
sethi
said
this
has
led
to
additional
costs
as
we
require
three
sets
of
crew
as
against
two
on
a
direct
haul
for
the
same
distance
lufthansa
started
operations
in
nepal
nine
years
ago
since
then
its
presence
in
the
himalayan
kingdom
has
grown
continuously
to
meet
the
growing
travel
and
export
demand
in
the
nepalese
market
lufthansa
has
three
weekly
flights
via
karachi
to
frankfurt
we
have
been
the

sengsavang
a

for
more
than

mr

was
a
tireless
promoter
of
lao
tourism
and
had
travelled
extensively
around
the
country
without
incident
travelling
by
road
from
vientiane
to
luang
prabang
is
not
considered
safe
another

spot
where

it
s
safe
to
travel
anywhere

to
european
travel

was
always
open

what
to

asia
that

transfers
to

allowed
said

prabang
is
still

happen
anytime
