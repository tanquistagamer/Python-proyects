optimal
estimation
and

a
fresh
look
a
controversial
and
important
all
new
five

course
from
one
of
the
outstanding
authorities
in
the
field
january

beach
fl
what
you
will
learn
that
lqg
and
kalman
theory
are
history
what
the
new
theory
is
all
about
where
it
s
likely
to
go
and
how
to
use
it
to
design
your
own
regulators
and
observers
who
should
attend
estimation
and
controls
practitioners
who
wish
to
get
much
better
performance
from
their
systems
by
merely
using
better
feedback
gain
matrices
those
interested
in
continuing
the
research
while
the
material
is
heavily
mathematical
the
essential
ideas
in
statistics
power
spectra
and
matrix
algebra
and
calculus
will
all
be
covered
summary
lqg
theory
for
regulators
and
kalman
theory
for
observers
both
require
you
to
believe
that
all
process
and
measurement
noise
is
white
and
gaussian
when
no
physical
noise
has
either
property
further
lqg
theory
forces
you
to
accept
that
minimizing
the
trace
of
a
weighted
covariance
of
the
state
variables
is
what
s
good
for
you
while
kalman
theory
relies
on
minimizing
the
trace
of
the
measurement
error
weighted
residuals
whose
relation
to
engineering
desires
is
tenuous
at
best
this
course
is
designed
to
show
you
how
to
design
optimal
regulators
and
observers
for
stationary
systems
based
on
knowledge
of
the
all
the
noise
power
spectra
and
using
performance
measures
that
are
much
more
sensitive
to
your
actual
engineering
needs
you
will
also
see
that
by
your
own
measure
performance
is
likely
to
be
greatly
improved
relative
to
lqg
or
kalman
derived
feedback
gains
while
several
papers
and
seminars
have
been
given
on
this
subject
this
is
the
first
course
offered
on
how
to
do
it
along
with
the
current
status
of
the
theory
throughout
obscure
matrix
relations
are
introduced
as
needed
caveat
this
theory
is
all
analog
it
s
the
oversampling
limit
of
a
system
with
infinite
computational
resources
a

will
be
given
on
directions

this
course
has
evolved
over
the
last
several
years
from
various
studies
papers
and
seminars
to
the
point
where
the
book
describing
the
new

spectra
has
just
been
published
