that

works
to

all
the

enshrined
in
the

of

through

education
programmes
and
campaigning
for
ratification
and
implementation
of
human

treaties
the
human
rights
of
women
have
been
specifically
targeted
by
amnesty
international
since
in
that
year
the
international
women
s
network
was
founded
following
the
decision
at
the
international
council
meeting
amnesty
international
s
supreme
governing
body
to
increase
the
focus
which
amnesty
gives
to
women
s
rights
the
reasons
for
amnesty
s
specific
targeting
of
women
s
rights
lie
within
the
reality
of
today
s
world
in
which
most
of
the
casualties
of
war
are
women
and
children
most
of
the
world
s
poor
are
women
and
children
and
of
the
world
s
refugees
are
women
and
children
women
are
in
double
jeopardy
discriminated
against
as
women
they
are
also
as
likely
as
men
if
not
more
so
to
become
victims
of
human
rights
violations
few
countries
treat
their
women
as
well
as
their
men
the
consequences
of
this
discrimination
are
terrible
more
women
and
girl
children
die
each
day
from
various
forms
of
gender
based
discrimination
and
violence
than
from
any
other
form
of
human
rights
abuse
every
year
according
to
the
un
children
s
fund
unicef
more
than
a
million
infant
girls
die
because
they
are
born
female
every
year
because
of
discrimination
millions
of
women
are
mutilated
battered
to
death
burned
alive
stripped
of
their
legal
rights
and
bought
and
sold
in
an
unacknowledged
but
international
trade
in
slaves
for
domestic
or
sexual
purposes
because
of
their
gender
women
are
at
risk
of
a
range
of
violent
abuses
by
private
organisations
and
individuals
the
global
status
of
women
has
necessitated
the
specification
and
clarification
of
the
existing
body
of
international
humanitarian
law
and
promotion
of
the
concept
that
women
s
rights

our
primary
objective
was
that
the

adopted
at

should
include
a
clear
statement
of
the
current
impediments

enjoyment
of
their
human

above
all
focus
on
practical
steps

conference
on

the
real
battlefield
in
the
fight
for
women

equality
is
still
back
at
home
in
the
context
of
the
cultural
religious
and
traditional
norms
that
govern
our
societies
only
by
exposing
the

situation
of

the

the
platform

is
the
document
produced
by

out
the
actions
to
be
undertaken
by

in
the
areas
of
education
review
of
national
laws
and

represents
an
important
step
by

all
over
the

rights
violations
against
women
and
includes
the
following
important
declaration
of
the
universality
and
indivisibility
of
all
human

while
the
significance
of
national
and
regional
particularities
and
various
historical
cultural
and
religious
backgrounds
must
be
borne
in
mind
it
is
the
duty
of

regardless
of
their
political
economic
and
cultural
systems
to
promote
and
protect
all
human

equal
right
of

rights
are
human
rights
and
the
need
to
take
action
to
curb
all
forms
of
violence
against
women
it
weaknesses
include
a
reluctance
to
identify
many
human
rights
violations
against
women
which
are
prevalent
throughout
the
world
in
peace
as
well
as
conflict
such
as

other
forms
of

inhuman
or
