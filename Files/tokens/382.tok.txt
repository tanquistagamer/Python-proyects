this
chapter
outlines
some
of
the
important
federal
and
state
laws
governing
the
legal
relationships
and
problems
between
employers
and
employees
the
employment
relationship
the
extent
of
a
worker
s
rights
depends
upon
the
legal
relationship
between
the
worker
and
his
or
her
employer
independent
contractor
versus
employee
when
a
worker
gets
paid
to
do
a
task
or
provide
a
service
for
another
person
the
worker
is
an
independent
contractor
or
an
employee
the
distinction
is
important
both
for
the
business
and
the
worker
but
it
is
not
always
clear
for
a
worker
the
classification
determines
the
benefits
to
which
he
or
she
is
entitled
whether
the
worker
is
covered
by
workers
compensation
and
whether
the
worker
is
protected
by
federal
and
state
wage
and
hour
regulations
employees
enjoy
substantially
more
protection
in
the
workplace
than
do
independent
contractors
whether
a
worker
is
an
independent
contractor
or
an
employee
is
based
on
the
work
performed
not
the
worker
s
title
the
more
control
an
employer
has
over
a
worker
the
more
likely
it
is
the
worker
is
an
employee
on
the
other
hand
the
more
a
worker
acts
like
an
independent
business
enterprise
the
more
likely
the
worker
is
an
independent
contractor
in
some
cases
the
status
is
clear
a
worker
who
arrives
at
a
set
time
every
day
is
trained
by
the
employer
uses
the
boss
s
tools
or
equipment
and
is
paid
by
the
hour
week
or
month
most
likely
is
an
employee
someone
who
works
for
more
than
one
company
at
a
time
sets
his
or
her
own
hours
and
realizes
a
profit
or
risks
a
loss
probably
is
an
independent
contractor
a
worker
or
an
employer
who
is
unsure
about
the
legal
status
of
his
or
her
employment
relationship
can
seek
advice
from
the
internal
revenue
service
the
illinois
department
of
revenue
the
illinois
department
of
employment
security
or
the
illinois
department
of
labor
employment
at
will
the
state
of
illinois
recognizes
the
traditional
rule
of
employment
at
will
this
means
that
all
workers
in
illinois
are
at
will
employees
unless
the
employer
takes
some
action
to
create
a
different
relationship
there
are
several
ways
an
employer
can
alter
the
relationship
an
employer
might
enter
into
an
oral
or
written
contract
guaranteeing
to
employ
someone
for
a
specific
period
of
time
or
promising
to
terminate
the
employee
only
for
specified
reasons
an
employee
handbook
or
collective
bargaining
agreement
may
limit
the
employer
s
right
to
terminate
employees
sometimes
employers
inadvertently
limit
their
right
to
fire
employees
if
by
their
actions
the
employers
give
the
employees
reason
to
believe
their
jobs
will
continue
for
example
if
an
employer
promises
a
job
to
someone
from
out
of
state
and
that
person
moves
to
illinois
specifically
to
take
the
job
the
employer
probably
has
changed
the
employment
relationship
the
employment
is
not
at
will
because
the
employee
has
gone
to
the
trouble
and
expense
of
moving
after
reasonably
relying
on
the
promise
of
new
employment
the
implications
of
the
at
will
relationship
are
far
reaching
unless
there
is
an
agreement
to
the
contrary
an
employer
may
discharge
an
employee
at
any
time
for
any
legal
reason
as
long
as
an
employee
is
not
fired
for
an
illegal
reason
such
as
racial
or
gender
discrimination
an
employer
does
not
need
a
good
reason
to
fire
someone
even
a
silly
reason
is
enough
it
also
means
that
an
employee
may
resign
at
any
time
for
any
reason
with
or
without
giving
notice
the
employee
is
free
to
leave
for
any
reason
at
all
even
if
by
doing
so
he
or
she

and
federal

workers

the
benefits
a
worker
enjoys
under
any
of
these
programs
depends
upon
the
terms
and
conditions
of
employment
unemployment
insurance
unemployment
insurance
provides
benefits
to
employees
who
are
laid
off
fired
or
forced
to
leave
their
jobs
most
employees
are
covered
by
unemployment
insurance
a
program
administered
by
the
state
and
funded
by
employer
contributions
application
unemployment
benefits
are
not
automatic
the
worker
must
apply
for
them
from
the
illinois
department
of
employment
security
after
gathering
information
about
an
applicant
the
department
makes
an
initial
determination
whether
the
person
is
eligible
to
receive
benefits
if
the
department
s
decision
is
that
the
employee
is
eligible
it
informs
the
former
employer
because
the
former
employer
contributes
to
pay
the
benefits
the
employer
has
the
right
to
some
of
the
information
given
by
the
former
employee
to
the
department
and
has
an
opportunity
to
present
information
eligibility
to
be
eligible
to
receive
unemployment
benefits
the
employee
must
have
worked
for
the
employer
for
a
certain
length
of
time
and
must
have
made
a
certain
amount
of
money
in
wages
the
time
period
is
called
a
base
period
and
it
is
based
on
the
calendar
quarter
system
eligible
employees
must
have
made
at
least
in
wages
during
the
base
period
to
collect
unemployment
benefits
a
person
also
must
be
available
for
work
have
registered
for
work
with
the
illinois
job
service
and
meet
a
few
other
provisions
not
everyone
who
leaves

is
eligible
to
receive

benefits
an

is
not
entitled

labor
strike

an
offer
to
work
again
for
the
former
employer
fails
to
seek
apply
for
or
accept
suitable
work
because
employers
and
employees
often
have
different
ideas
of
what
constitutes
a
reasonable
work
environment
the
issue
in
most
disputed
unemployment
claims
is
whether
the
employer
created
an
intolerable
workplace
environment
only
certain
kinds
of
employer
actions
give
an
employee
a
legitimate
reason
to
quit
a
job
and
still
collect
unemployment
benefits
some
of
these
valid
reasons
include
sexual
harassment
by
an
employer
or
inaction
by
an
employer
who
was
informed
of
instances
of
sexual
harassment
a
substantial
cut
in
pay
or
benefits
drastic
changes
in
working

consent
requiring
an

to
break
the
law
or
work
under
obviously
unsafe
conditions
demotions
modest
decreases
in
wages
or
benefits
disagreements
over
management
policy
and
reasonable
changes
in
workplace
hours
or
employee
regulations
are
conditions
of
employment
that
do
not
create
an
intolerable
working
environment
for
purposes
of
eligibility
to
collect
unemployment
benefits
benefits
if
the
department
decides
that
an
applicant
is
eligible
to
receive
benefits
the
former

receives
a
weekly

a
percentage
of
his
or
her

the
civil

act
of
and
the
americans
with

act
of
protect
the
rights
of
workers
to
be
free
from
workplace
discrimination
in
the
united
states
illinois
workers
have
additional
protection
under
the
illinois
human
rights
act
for
example
the
americans
with
disabilities
act
only
applies
to
employers
with
or
more
employees
after
july
but
the
illinois
human
rights
act
covers
alleged
discrimination
based
on
physical
mental
or
perceived
handicap
by
any
illinois
employers
with
one
or
more
employees
in
addition
the
illinois
law
covers
more
types
of
discrimination
than
the
federal
laws
employees
also
should
be
aware
that
there
may
be
local
anti
discrimination
laws
applicable
to
their
employment
situation
for
example
cook
county
and
the
city
of
chicago
both
have
employment
rights
laws
that
apply
to
all
employers
with
employees
that
is
even
an
employer
with
one
employee
in
chicago
or
cook
county
is
subject
to
local
employment
laws
in
general
most
employment
discrimination
is
outlawed
by
the
two
major
civil
rights
acts
passed
by
congress
in
and
and
by
the
illinois
human
rights
act
through
a
combination
of
these
laws
illinois
workers
are
protected
against
discrimination
based
on
age
ancestry
arrest
record
citizenship
color
creed
disability
marital
status
national
origin
race
religion
sex
or
unfavorable
military
discharge
people
frequently
refer
to
title
vii
rights
when
they
are
talking
about
a
particular
section
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
title
vii
prohibits
discrimination
in
a
wide
number
of
employment
areas
including
advertisements
for
jobs
apprenticeship
programs
benefits
firing
hiring
layoffs
promotions
recalls
recruitment
testing
training
and
transfers
title
vii
also
prohibits
retaliation
against
a
person
who
files
a
charge
of
discrimination
participates
in
an
investigation
of
discrimination
or
opposes
an
unlawful
employment
practice
under
certain
extremely
limited
circumstances
employers
are
allowed
to
base
their
employment
decisions
or
practices
on
a
person
s
marital
status
race
sex
etc
if
the
employer
can
demonstrate
a
truly
legitimate
need
for
example
it
is
legal
to
hire
only
women
to
be
attendants
in
women
s
locker
rooms
religious
institutions
may
refuse
to
hire
individuals
based
on
their
religious
beliefs
but
only
for
positions
that
are
directly
related
to
the
performance
of
religious
duties
they
generally
are
not
allowed
to
discriminate
when
hiring
individuals
for
secular
tasks
such
as
secretarial
or
janitorial
work
certain
employers
such
as
police
departments
may
base
some
employment
decisions
on
an
applicant
s
physical
abilities
other
types
of
hiring
criteria
are
allowed
if
they
measure
skills
that
are
truly
essential
for
an
applicant
to
have
in
order
to
perform
a
particular
job
and
if
they
are
not
applied
in
a
selective
or
discriminatory
way
for
example
an
employer
may
require
applicants
for
administrative
jobs
to
pass
typing
or
computer
skills
examinations
proving
discrimination
in
the
workplace
depends
on
the
specifics
of
each
situation
generally
it
is
easier
to
prove
discrimination
from
a
repeated
pattern
of
behavior
rather
than
an
isolated
incident
for
example
if
several
mexican
immigrants
are
passed
over
for
promotions
in
favor
of
non
immigrants
and
all
the
people
involved
have
the
same
qualifications
a
good
case
may
be
made
to
charge
unlawful
discrimination
in
addition
any
documented
evidence
showing
an
employer
is
prejudiced
against
a
class
of
people
can
strengthen
a
discrimination
case
if
an
employer
makes
statements
such
as
blacks
don
t
take
orders
well
or
women
aren
t
capable
of
making
tough
management
decisions
this
likely
will
increase
an
applicant
s
chances
of
proving
discrimination
especially
if
the
statements
are
made
repeatedly
and
in
the
presence
of
witnesses
a
person
who
feels
that
he
or
she
has
been
unfairly
discriminated
against
or
harassed
in
the
workplace
may
file
a
complaint
with
the
illinois
department
of
human
rights
or
the
federal
equal
employment
opportunity
commission
eeoc
the
illinois
department
of
human
rights
enforces
the
illinois
human
rights
act
and
the
eeoc
enforces
the
federal
civil
rights
acts
that
apply
to
the
workplace
when
a
person
files
a
complaint
with
one
agency
that
agency
cross
files
with
the
other
agency
a
victim
of
discrimination
only
has
days
to
file
a
complaint
with
either
agency
another
option
for
a
victim
of
discrimination
is
to
hire
a
private
attorney
to
pursue
a
claim
against
an
employer
a
civil
action
for
violation
of
the
illinois
human
rights
act
must
be
filed
within
two
years
of
the
termination
or
other
occurrence

the

vii
prohibitions
against
age
discrimination
most
employers
may
not
enforce
mandatory
retirement
policies
except
under
a
few
very
specific
circumstances
in
which
age
is
a
valid
qualification
for
doing
a
particular
job
such
as
firefighting
police
work
or

anyone
age

cannot
be
retired
against
his
or
her
will
regardless
of
age
as
long
as
he
or
she
can
do
the
job
the
illinois
human
rights
act
contains
similar
provisions
that
apply
to
illinois
employers
with
only
one
employee
other
federal
and
state
laws
prevent
discrimination
based
on
age
with
some
exceptions
allowing
employers
to
force
an
employee
age
or
older
to
retire
discrimination
against
persons
with
disabilities
the
americans
with
disabilities
act
of
ada
is
a
federal
law
that
prohibits
discrimination
based
on
a
person
s
physical
or
mental
ability
the
ada
makes
it
illegal
to
fire
or
to
refuse
to
hire
someone
because
that
person
lacks
physical
or
mental
abilities
that
are
not
essential
to
the
job
the
ada
does
not
change
an
employer
s
right
to
employ
only
people
who
have
the
skills
to
perform
the
essential
duties
of
a
job
for
example
an
employer
may
not
refuse
to
hire
as
a
daycare
provider
a
person
with
epilepsy
simply
because
the
potential
employee
cannot
drive
to
a
hospital
in
an
emergency
in
this
example
driving
is
not
an
essential
duty
of
the
job
so
it
is
not
a
valid
reason
to
discriminate
against
an
applicant
who
is
unable
to
get
a
driver
s
license
because
of
his
or
her
epilepsy
the
ada
requires
employers
to
make
reasonable
accommodations
for
applicants
or
employees
with
disabilities
the
employer
must
do
whatever
is
reasonable
to
accommodate
a
person
s
disability
including
modifying
work
schedules
providing
special
training
changing
the
work
environment
buying
or
modifying
special
equipment
or
reassigning
to
another
position
an
employee
who
no
longer
is
able
to
do
the
essential
duties
of
a
job
a
reasonable
accommodation
is
one
that
does
not
place
an
undue
burden
on
the
employer
using
pre
employment
tests
that
identify
and
exclude
applicants
with
disabilities
is
permissible
only
if
the
tests
are
unequivocally
job
related
the
ada
only
protects
from
discrimination
people
with
permanent
conditions
that
limit
a
major
life
activity
thus
the
ada
does
not
cover
an
employee
who
has
a
sprained
ankle
that
is
expected
to
heal
fully
even
though
that
employee
is
disabled

sexual
harassment
everyone
has
the
right
to
be
free
from
sexual
harassment
in
the
workplace
sexual
harassment
is
prohibited
by
the
illinois
human
rights
act
and
is
punishable
as
an
illegal
form
of
sex
discrimination
under
title
vii
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
sexual
harassment
can
take
many
forms
sexual
or
sexist
comments
about
a
coworker
s
appearance
a
mandatory
dress
code
that
provokes
others
to
make
sexually
explicit
comments
unwanted
sexual
contact
or

suggestions
or
pressure

any
of
the
above
activities
is
required
to
get
or
keep
a
job
to
be
promoted
or
to
qualify
for
benefits
or
if
the
activity
makes
it
harder
for
a
worker
to
do
his
or
her
job
by
creating
a
hostile
environment
the
behavior
must
be
unwelcome
undesirable
and
offensive
to
be
considered
sexual
harassment
the
law
uses
the
reasonable
person
standard
to
determine
what
is
offensive
if
a
reasonable
person
would
find
an
action
offensive
then
it
is
offensive
under
the
law
determining
what
kind
of
behavior
constitutes
sexual
harassment
may
depend
on
the
circumstances
however
some
general
descriptions
of
sexual
harassment
can
be
made
a
single
or
occasional
sexual
joke
or
sexual
comment
is
not
sexual
harassment
unless
the
comment
unequivocally
offers
workplace
advancement
in
return
for
sexual
favors
unwanted
touching
of
someone
else
s
body
is
sexual
harassment
someone
who
repeatedly
tells
lewd
or
obscene
jokes
that
make
other
employees
uncomfortable
may
be
guilty
of
sexual
harassment
especially
if
the
person
has
been
told
that
he
or
she
makes
the
workplace
uncomfortable
a
case
for
sexual
harassment
in
this
example
would
be
weakened
if
the
person
claiming
harassment
participates
in
the
joke
telling
in
addition
to
laws
designed
to
give
victims
a
civil
remedy
against
sexual
harassment
criminal
laws
provide
remedies
against
the
most
serious
forms
of
unwanted
sexual
contact
people
who
believe
they
are
victims
of
sexual
harassment
should
contact
the
eeoc
the
illinois
department
of
human

or
the

if
a

s
behavior
crosses
the

into
assault

or
rape
the
victim
may
file
criminal
charges
against
the
perpetrator
these
crimes
are

privacy
employees
right
to
privacy
at
work
is
a
hotly
debated
issue
today
as
increasing
numbers
of
employers
are
using
searches
surveillance
and
eavesdropping
in
an
attempt
to
better
monitor
their
employees
activities
the
law
in
this
area
is
evolving
and
is
largely
unsettled
but
it
is
fair
to
say
that
an
employee
surrenders
some
of
his
or
her
right
to
privacy
at
the
workplace
door
employers
have
more
of
a
legal
right
to
monitor
employees
than
governments
have
to
monitor
citizens
when
a
court
must
determine
whether
an
employee
s
right
to
privacy
was
violated
it
looks
at
whether
the
employee
s
expectation
of
privacy
in
a
particular
situation
was
reasonable
for
example
the
expectation
of
privacy
is
more
reasonable
for
items
in
a
locked
desk
drawer
than
for
items
left
out
on
a
desk
similarly
it
is
more
reasonable
to
expect
privacy
during
a
personal
phone
call
made
on
a
pay
phone
than
for
a
work
related
call
on
the
employer
s
phone
the
reasonable
expectation
standard
is
not
a
very
strong
guarantor
of
employee
privacy
an
employer
may
expand
his
or
her
right
to
search
or
monitor
simply
by
giving
notice
to
employees
once
an
employee
receives
notice
that
the
employer
reserves
the
right
to
monitor
calls
search
offices
read
electronic
mail
or
film
the
workplace
there
is
very
little
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy
whistleblowing
it
is
illegal
for
an
employer
to
fire
a
worker
in
retaliation
for
reporting
a
violation
of
law
or
for
refusing
to
participate
in
activity
the
employee
believes
to
be
illegal
if
an
employee
acts
in
good
faith
and
reports
suspected
illegal
activities
to
the
employer
a
governmental
agency
or
law
enforcement
officer
the
employee
cannot
be
fired
or
be
treated
adversely
this
workplace
right
is
covered
by
workers
compensation
laws
an
employee
who
is
terminated
for
whistleblowing
may
sue
the
employer
for
retaliatory
discharge
employee

illinois

the
