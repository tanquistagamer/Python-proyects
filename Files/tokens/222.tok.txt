a
record
journalists
were
in
prison
in
countries
at
the
end
of
the
committee
to
protect
journalists
reported
today
in
attacks
on
the
press
in
its
annual
book
length
survey
of
press
freedom
violations
around
the
world
for
the
second
consecutive
year
turkey
held
more
journalists
in
jail
than
any
other
country
as
the
government
continued
to
suppress
independent
reporting
on
the
kurdish
conflict
the
committee
to
protect
journalists
today
called
on
prime
minister
mesut
yilmaz
to
release
turkey
s
imprisoned
journalists
and
rescind
the
laws
used
to
punish
and
censor
the
local
press
turkey
surpasses
such
totalitarian
regimes
as
china
and
syria
in
its
willingness
to
throw
journalists
in
jail
said
cpj
chair
kati
marton
the
new
turkish
government
should
demonstrate
its
commitment
to
democracy
by
releasing
our
imprisoned
colleagues
and
abolishing
article
of
the
anti
terror
law
and
article
of
the
penal
code
which
are
inherently
incompatible
with
press
freedom
the
number
of
confirmed
cases
of
imprisoned
journalists
in
exceeds
cpj
s
accounting
for
a
then
record
imprisoned
journalists
at
year
s
end
the
increase
in
was
largely
attributable
to
the
recent
crackdown
on
independent
journalism
in
ethiopia
and
nigeria
in
each
of
the
cases
documented
in
attacks
on
the
press
in
cpj
staff
researchers
verified
that
the
jailed
journalists
were
imprisoned
as
a
direct
reprisal
for
their
reporting
and
remained
incarcerated
on
dec
imprisonment
is
a
very
effective
form
of
censorship

attacks
on
the

in

that
at

at

were

of

were

the
legal
tools
used
to
imprison
nbsp
journalists
though
the
political
contexts
of
these
imprisonments
vary
widely
from
country
to
country
the
incarcerations
of
journalists
fall
into
several
broad
categories
some
representative
cases
turkey
isik
ocak
yurtcu
the
editor
of
ozgur
gundem
turkey
s
leading
pro
kurdish
daily
was
imprisoned
on

charged
under
article
of
the
anti
terror
law
he
was
convicted
of
publishing
separatist
propaganda
he
remains
in
prison
serving
a
year
sentence
article
of
the
anti
terror
law
defines
nongovernmental
accounts
of
the
kurdish
conflict
as
proscribed
propaganda
publishing
such
independent
reports
is
a
criminal
offense
turkey
is
the
biggest
offender
in
this
category
but
it
is
not
unique
in
ethiopia
and
many
other
countries
journalists
writing
or
broadcasting
reports
on
civil
war
or
ethnic
strife
are
accused
of
violating
broadly
drafted
hate
speech
laws
as
if
their
reporting
were
the
cause
rather
than
a
consequence
of
those
conflicts

igiebor

were
confirmed
by

cpj
sources
in

the
