law
real
estate
law
involves
rights
in
the
ownership
and
possession
of
land
and
buildings
attached
to
land
real
estate
law
often
is
referred
to
as
the
law
of
real
property
to
distinguish
it
from
the
law
of
personal
property
which
includes
all
other
property
a
stumbling
block
for
many
consumers
entering
the
real
estate
market
is
the
number
of
unfamiliar
terms
frequently
used
by
real
estate
professionals
because
real
estate
is
one
of
the
oldest
areas
of
the
law
it
uses
many
old
terms
and
concepts
but
many
rights
and
responsibilities
regarding
real
estate
have
evolved
and
been
updated
as
society
has
changed

summarizes
some
of
the
real

and
responsibilities

encumbrance
an
encumbrance
is
a
legal
interest
in
property
held
by
someone
other
than
the
owner
of
the
property
an
encumbrance
is
not
an
ownership
interest
in
real
property
but
it
creates
some
kind
of
obligation
for
the
owner
an
encumbrance
attaches
to
the
property
not
the
property
owner
so
the
property
may
be
bought
and
sold
even
though
there
is
an
encumbrance
attached
easement
an
easement
is
the
right
to
use
another
person
s
land
for
a
particular
purpose
there
are
many
forms
of
easements
public
utility

have
utility

them
to
run
gas
water
or
electrical
lines
through
the
property
of
others
the
owner
of

near
a
lake
might

to
cross
his
or
her
property
to
access
the
lake
a

lien
a

is
a
charge
against

that
provides
security
for
a
debt
or
obligation
of
the
property

are
voluntary

takes
out
a
mortgage
other
liens
may
be
imposed
for
example
a

one
of
the
most

or
materials
to
improve
a
piece
of

property
owner
and

the
amount
owed
from
a
subsequent
sale
of
the
property

an

is
a
value
placed
on
real
property
by
a
local
taxing
authority
for
the

taxes
real

are
calculated
by

the
assessed
value
of
a
piece
of
property
by
the
tax
rate
most
properties
are
reassessed
periodically
and
a
property
s
assessed
value
may
not
be
the
same
as
its
actual
market
value
a
special
assessment
is
a
tax
levied
on
a
piece
of
property
to

the
following
rights
to

as
security
for
loans
encumber
to
improve
the
land
or
buildings
on
the
land
to
use
and
possess
the
property
property
can
be
owned
by
one
or
more
persons
the
two
common
ways
in
which
parties
co
own
a
piece
of
property
are
joint
tenancy
and
tenancy
in
common
joint
tenancy
although
joint
tenancy
is
a
popular
way
for
a
husband
and
wife
to
own
property
there
is
no
requirement
that
joint
tenants
be
married
or
that
there
only
be
two
joint
tenants
owners
in
joint
tenancy
have
a
right
to
sell
encumber
and
possess
the
entire
property
when
one
joint
tenant
dies
the
remaining
joint
tenants
automatically
take
the
deceased
joint
tenant
s
share
of
the
property
by
right
of
survivorship
the
surviving
joint
tenants
are
required
to
file
a
death
certificate
and
an
affidavit
with
the
county
recorder
joint
tenancy
allows
the
surviving
joint
tenants
to
avoid
probate
transfer
and
death
taxes
tenants
in
common
tenants
in
common
like
joint
tenants
share
the
right
to
possess
sell
and
encumber
the
property
unlike
joint
tenants
however
tenants
in
common
do
not
have
a
right
of
survivorship
upon
the
death
of
one
tenant
in
common
his
or
her
ownership
interest
passes
to
his
or
her
heirs
as
part
of
the
estate
advantages
and
disadvantages
of
co
ownership
although
there
are
advantages
to
co
owning
property
there
are
drawbacks
as
well
if
co
owners
cannot
agree
on
use
sale
or
possession
of
a
piece
of
property
they
may
have
to
go
to
court
to
resolve
the
matter
in
a
partition
action
in
a
partition
action
a
joint
tenant
or
tenant
in
common
asks
the
court
to
split
the
property
in
a
fair
and
just
manner
real
property
may
be
difficult
to
divide
and
partial
interests
may
be
difficult
to
sell
so
a
court
will
usually
order
that
the
property
be
sold
and
proceeds
from
the
sale
distributed
to
the
co
owners
in
relation
to
their
interests
residential
real
estate
the
most
common
consumer
real
estate
transaction
involves
the
sale
of
a
home
unlike
years
past
today
a
home
buyer
has
a
variety
of
options
in
deciding
the
type
of
dwelling
to
buy
single
family
houses
are
still
the
most
common
selections
for
home
buyers
single
family
homes
provide
the
maximum
amount
of
privacy
and
freedom
to
their
owners
but
they
may
also
be
the
most
expensive
option
and
require
the
most
upkeep
condominiums
and
townhouses
may
be
an
option
for
some
purchasers
both
give
their
owners
many
of
the
advantages
of
home
ownership
such
as
tax
deductibility
of
mortgage
interest
without
some
of
the
responsibilities
some
people
consider
to
be
disadvantages
such
as
lawn
care
and
exterior
upkeep
residents
usually
pay
association
fees
to
cover
maintenance
a
homestead
is
not
a
particular
type
of
dwelling
instead
it
is
a
tax
classification
that
can
dramatically
lower
what
a
homeowner
pays
in
real
estate
taxes
people
who
live
in
the
property
they
own
are
taxed
at
a
much
lower
rate
than
if
they
rent
out
that
property
to
others
if
a
person
buys
property
that
currently
is
rental
property
he
or
she
must
fill
out
an
application
to
change
the
property
s
tax
status
otherwise
the
person
could
end
up
paying
non
homestead
taxes
for
the
first
year
of
ownership
title
title
to
real
estate
is
the
ownership
of
the
property
title
may
refer
to
the
actual
ownership
or
to
the
documentary
evidence
of
that
ownership
title
is
what
gives
the
owner
the
right
to
the
property
in
order
to
sell
a
piece
of
property
all
title
matters
must
be
cleared
usually
this
is
accomplished
through
a
title
search
a
title
search
is
a
diligent
search
of
all
records
relating
to
the
property
to
determine
whether
the
owner
is
authorized
to
sell
the
property
and
whether
there
are
any
claims
against
it
if
any
defects
in
title
are
discovered
during
the
title
search
the
seller
usually
has
time
to
cure
the
defect
often
people
have
title
insurance
to
protect
them
against
any
hidden
defects
in
the
title
there
are
two
types
of
title
insurance
one
type
protects
the
lender
s
interest
in
the
property
and
the
other
protects
the
home
owner
s
interest
deeds
a
deed
is
a
written
instrument
that
transfers
the
title
of
property
from
one
person
to
another
there
are
many
different
types
of
deeds
generally
in
illinois
title
is
transferred
by
a
general
warranty
deed
a
general
warranty
deed
provides
the
greatest
protection
to
the
purchaser
because
the
seller
pledges
or
warrants
that
he
or
she
legally
owns
the
property
and
that
there
are
no
outstanding
liens
mortgages
or
other
encumbrances
against
it
a
warranty
deed
is
also
a
guarantee
of
title
which
means
that
the
seller
may
be
held
liable
for
damages
if
the
buyer
discovers
that
the
title
is
defective
a
warranty
deed
is
no
substitute
for
title
insurance
however
because
a
warranty
from
a
seller
who
later
dies
or
goes
bankrupt
may
have
little
value
another
type
of
deed
used
is
a
quitclaim
deed
a
quitclaim
deed
relinquishes
whatever
interest
if
any
the
seller
may
have
in
the
property
to
the
buyer
a
quitclaim
deed
gives
the
buyer
the
least
protection
of
any
deed
if
the
seller
is
the
sole
owner
of
the
property
the
quitclaim
deed
is
enough
to
transfer
title
but
the
buyer
takes
a
risk
by
accepting
a
quitclaim
deed
because
it
offers
the
buyer
no
guarantee
that
the
title
is
valid
quitclaim
deeds
customarily
are
used
during
the
property
settlement
phase
of
a
marriage
dissolution
recording
in
illinois
real
estate
owners
and
parties
with
real
estate
interests
are
required
to
file
with
the
county
all
documents
affecting
their
interest
in
property
in
order
to
give
public
notice
of
the
interest
since
illinois
titles
are
transferred
under
the
abstract
system
abstract
records
go
back
hundreds
of
years
and
an
abstract
of
title
is
a
record
of
all
the
entries
for
that
property
buying
or
selling
a
home
because
illinois
has
many
programs
to
help
people
buy
a
home
home
ownership
is
a
possibility
for
people
at
all
income
levels
buying
a
home
may
be
both
rewarding
and
stressful
every
home
purchase
involves
a
number
of
complex
legal
issues
unfamiliar
terminology
and
lots
of
paperwork
knowing
how
the
process
works
may
reduce
much
of
the
headache
real
estate
agents
one
of
the
first
decisions
for
someone
interested
in
buying
or
selling
a
home
is
whether
to
use
the
services
of
a
real
estate
agent
real
estate
agents
are
hired
to
help
buyers
and
sellers
meet
to
complete
the
sale
of
a
house
home
buyers
and
sellers
may
choose
to
work
with
an
agent
exclusively
or
non
exclusively
a
person
who
decides
to
work
with
an
agent
will
sign
several
contracts
to
clarify
the
relationship
between
the
consumer
and
the
agent
these
contracts
may
include
provisions
regarding
dual
agency
this
term
refers
to
the
arrangement
in
which
an
agent
represents
both
the
buyer
and
the
seller
of
the
house
it
may
be
difficult
for
one
agent
to
represent
both
a
buyer
and
a
seller
fairly
when
the
agent
finds
a
buyer
for
a
house
that
the
agency
has
listed
the
agent
s
dual
loyalties
become
apparent
the
seller
wants
the
highest
price
possible
while
the
buyer
wants
to
pay
the
lowest
price
the
contracts
state
what
the
agent
may
share
with
the
other
party
and
which
information
must
remain
confidential
seller
disclosures
in
illinois
the
residential
real
property
disclosure
act
requires
that
when
a
seller
signs
the
standard
purchase
agreement
he
or
she
must
attach
a
disclosure
document
this
document
must
disclose
to
the
buyer
any
material
defects
which
are
known
hazards
or
problems
with
the
structure
or
the
heating
plumbing
mechanical
or
electrical
system
just
because
problems
are
listed
on
this
statement
does
not
mean
that
the
seller
must
repair
the
problems
but
the
buyer
may
request
either
repair
or
a
price
break
because
of
the
problem
in
some
communities
the
seller
also
is
required
to
complete
an
inspection
report
in
that
case
an
inspector
checks
the
house
for
defects
and
these
defects
are
listed
in
the
report
home
warranties
whenever
a
builder
sells
a
home
in
illinois
the
home
comes
with
an
implied
warranty
of
habitability
this
means
that
the
builder
guarantees
that
there
are
no
major
problems
with
the
home
even
problems
that
may
not
be
apparent
right
away
the
buyer
has
a
reasonable
amount
of
time
to
discover
any
major
problems
covered
under
the
warranty
for
example
if
it
rains
every
day
for
a
month
and
the
roof
does
not
leak
everyone
may
assume
the
roof
is
sound
if
the
roof
begins
leaking
during
a
rainy
period
a
year
later
it
is
probably
too
late
to
claim
the
house
was
sold
with
a
defective
roof
the
buyer
had
a
reasonable
amount
of
time
to
discover
the
defect
the
leaky
roof
would
not
be
covered
under
the
implied
warranty
of
habitability
illinois
law
also
provides
that
any
residential
unit
sold
by
installment
contract
is
voidable
unless
there
is
attached
to
the
contract
information
about
dwelling
code
compliance
the
seller
may
attach
either
a
certificate
of
compliance
or
may
include
an
express
written
warranty
that
the
home
has
not
been
the
subject
of
any
dwelling
code
violations
in
the
past
ten
years
if
there
have
been
violations
the
seller
must
attach
a
copy
of
every
notice
of
violation
home
buyers
should
be
aware
of
state
laws
dealing
with
removal
of
lead
based
paint
from
a
home
the
lead
poisoning
prevention
act
requires
owners
to
remove
replace
or
secure
and
permanently
cover
walls
covered
in
lead
based
paint
owners
must
take
care
of
lead
problems
after
receiving
notice
from
the
department
of
public
health
failure
to
comply
with
the
act
may
subject
the
owner
to
criminal
misdemeanor
charges
foreclosure
nobody
in
the
process
of
buying
a
house
wants
to
think
about
the
possibility
of
falling
behind
in
house
payments
to
the
extent
that
the
bank
or
mortgage
company
will
foreclose
on
the
loan
and
claim
possession
of
the
house
nevertheless
it
is
wise
for
a
consumer
to
understand
why
a
lender
forecloses
on
a
piece
of
property
so
the
consumer
can
minimize
the
possibility
of
losing
a
house
up
to
a
point
a
lender
will
typically
work
with
a
homeowner
who
falls
behind
in
making
payments
because
the
lender
does
not
want
to
go
through
the
hassle
and
expense
of
foreclosing
on
a
property
homeowners
should
communicate
with
their
lenders
if
there
are
financial
difficulties
present
that
make
paying
the
mortgage
difficult
it
can
take
months
for
a
lender
to
begin
a
foreclosure
and
more
months
before
it
is
completed
so
usually
there
is
time
to
get
the
money
needed
to
assure
a
lender
that
there
will
not
be
a
default
after
a
lender
begins
the
foreclosure
process
there
is
a
period
of
time
called
a
redemption
period
during
which
a
homeowner
can
stop
the
foreclosure
by
making
all
delinquent
mortgage
payments
plus
the
lender
s
court
costs
and
attorney
fees
in
illinois
a
lender
may
accept
the
deed
to
the
property
instead
of
foreclosing
the
property
owner
loses
the
property
but
if
he
or
she
truly
has
no
other
way
to
avoid
foreclosure
offering
the
deed
as
a
way
to
satisfy
the
debt
can
prevent
his
or
her
credit
rating
from
being
severely
damaged
by
a
foreclosure
however
because
lenders
generally
want
cash
and
not
real
estate
there
is
no
guarantee
that
a
lender
will
accept
a
deed
offered
in
lieu
of
foreclosure
a
notice
of
foreclosure
must
state
the
name
of
the
person
whose
property
is
subject
to
foreclosure
the
court
the
case
number
the
name
of
the
person
who
holds
the
title
to
the
property
a
legal
description
of
the
property
and
the
mortgage
identification
information
it
must
be
signed
by
the
foreclosing
party
or
the
party
s
attorney
landlord
tenant
under
illinois
law
whenever
the
owner
landlord
of
a
house
apartment
room
or
any
other
living
space
agrees
to
let
someone
else

use
