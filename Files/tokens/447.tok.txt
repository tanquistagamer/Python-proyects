turned

was
already

the

an

going

information

i
can
t
imagine
anyone
associating

herself
with
such
a
person
especially
if
there
were
something
conspiratorial
going

more
likely
is
the

there
are
lots

maybe
even
an

then
went

let
s
do

let

imagine
that
in

russia
or
some

major
nation
someone
is
seeking
the
job
of
chief
analyst
of
american
politics
this
person
is
given
this
news
story
and
asked
to
produce
a
report
on
its
significance
using
all
the
latest
information
technology
and
best
relevant
data
would
the
analysis
that
the
contact
was
probably
a
bureaucratic
snafu
without
any
larger
political
significance
get
the
analyst
the
job
i
don
t
know
this
is
just
a
question
to
produce
a
thought
or
two
i
have
no
opinions
about
the
news

other
than
to
notice
that
it
is
possibly
interesting
and
that
the
facts
should
be

reference

cross

the

i
think
your
last
sentence
hits
it
on
the
head
the
new
nuclear
problems
out
of
the
old
ussr
have
indeed
gotten
short
shrift
in
fact
last
year
there
was
a
bit
of
a
scandal
regarding
germany
s
bnd
and
what
may
have
been
a
setup
to
sting
such
people
as
loutchansky
might
be
the
main
significance
is
that
there
is
clearly
a
market
for
this
and
when
you
combine
it
with
what
i
think
david
huff
was
pointing
out
in
his
earlier
post
on
mini
nukes
it
does
serve
to
lower
one
s
comfort
level
