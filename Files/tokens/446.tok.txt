nordex
connections
time
magazine
in
an
expose
on
loutchansky
only
three
months
ago
reported
that
nordex
based
in
vienna
and
moscow
has
been
one
of
the
top
intelligence
targets
in
the
west
since
nordex
was
formed
in
to
trade
russian
commodities
and
natural
resources
with
the
west
allegations
have
surfaced
that
the
firm
has
been

loutchansky
a
former
professor
and
latvian
university
official
who
once
served
a
two
year
term
in
prison
for
embezzlement
has
not
been
charged
with
any
crimes
in
russia
or
elsewhere
since
he
founded
nordex
according
to
a
secret
german
intelligence
report
nordex
was
created
by
the
old
soviet
regime
with
the
aim
of
bringing
foreign
currency
accumulated
by
the
kgb
and
top
communist
party
officials
into
the
west
as
well
as
a
means
to
continue
earning
hard
currency
for
russian
intelligence
organizations
domestic
intelligence
sources
believe
numerous
such
companies
were
created
for
that
purpose
but
nordex
with
its
billion
in
annual
business
appears
to
be
the
largest
such
concern
operating
in
the
west
nordex
also
may
be
the
most
dangerous
in
the
spring
of
ukrainian
officials
in
kiev
inspected
a
nordex
owned
cargo
plane
that
had
emanated
in
north
korea
and
was
destined
for
iraq
the
aircraft
was
carrying
scud
missile
warheads
suspicions
too
have
been
raised
about
nuclear
smuggling
to
rogue
states
like
iran
iraq
and
north
korea
according
to
time
in
the
past
three
years
the
national
security
agency
has
found
indications
that
nordex
has
been
engaged
on
the
black
market
with
nuclear
materials
christopher

editor
of
the
london

soviet
analyst
the
one
time
british
foreign
office
newsletter
on
russian
matters
told
the
tribune
review
that
sources
in
british
intelligence
believe
nordex
is
a
rapidly
proliferating
amoeba
or
cancer
constantly
replicating
and
mutating
into
a
network
of
business
fronts
engaged
in
enterprises
ultimately
controlled
by
russian
intelligence
nordex
controls
more
than
russian
firms
and
has
more
than
three
dozen
businesses
in
the
west
second
invitation
in
an
unpublished
extensive
interview
with
time
magazine
excerpts
of
which
the
tribune
review
has
obtained
loutchansky
explained
how
he
ended
up
meeting
with
clinton
i
was
invited
by
a
friend
of
mine
sam
domb
he
was
a
trustee
sic
of
the
democratic
national
committee
to
take
part
in
a
dinner
which
was
given
by
mr
clinton
and
mr
gore
and
senators
in
october
it
was
in
washington
in
some
museum
i
was
invited
as
an
outstanding
jewish
businessman
loutchansky
went
on
to
say
he
spoke
privately
with
the
president
for
about
two
minutes
discussing
the
problems
of
nuclear
missiles
in
the
ukraine
loutchansky
also
told
the
jerusalem
report
he
agreed
to
a
request
from
the
president
to
deliver
a
private
message
to
the
leader
of
the
ukraine
new
york
businessman
sam
domb
told
the
tribune
review
he
has
no
idea
who
loutchansky
was
and
had
never
met
him
before
the
dinner
domb
apparently
agitated
by
the
call
had
no
explanation
as
to
why
he
was
photographed
with
loutchansky
and
clinton
or
why
he
was
previously
quoted
extensively
in
a
russian
emigre
newspaper
praising
loutchansky
according
to
federal
election
commission
records
in
the
months
immediately
following
the
october
washington
dinner
domb
donated
to
the
dnc
in
the
past
three
years
he
has
forked
over
to
the
committee
loutchansky
has
stated
he
never
donated
any
money
to
the
democratic
party
or
the
clinton
gore
campaign
federal
law
prohibits
donations
by
foreign
individuals
or
companies
to
political
candidates
or
parties
sometimes
foreigners
try
to
skirt
the
law
by
having
american
citizens
make
donations
on
their
behalf
there
is
no
evidence
that
has
occurred
here
but
loutchansky
has
a
track
record
in
russia
and
elsewhere
of
showering
officials
with
money
and
gifts
for
favors
and
access
for
instance
time
located
a
dummy
swiss
company
owned
by
nordex
called
dorotel
ag
which
according
to
a
nordex
official
was
nothing
more
than
a
bank
account
used
to
make
discreet
payments
for
friends
of
nordex
calls
to
the
democratic
national
committee
for
comment
as
to
why
loutchansky
was
invited
to
a
fund
raising
dinner
for
the
president
and
why
loutchansky
according
to
a
source
familiar
with
the
case
received
a
letter
from
the
president
thanking
him
for
his
support
went
unreturned
also
unexplained
is
the
invitation
loutchansky
received
just
last
year
from
the
democratic
national
committee
for
a
vip
dinner
with
clinton
dear
mr
loutchansky
wrote
dnc
finance
director
richard
sullivan
i
cordially
invite
you
to
have
dinner
with
president
clinton
on
tuesday
july
at
the
hay
adams
hotel
in
washington
d
c
loutchansky
told
the
jerusalem
report
he
did
not
go
to
that
event
because
he
feared
u
s
officials
would
not
allow
him
to
enter
the
country
already
loutchansky
has
been
barred
from
britain
and
canada
soviet
analyst
editor
story
suggested
loutchansky
s
meeting
and
invitations
to
see
clinton
were
nothing
short
of
scandal
it
s
preposterous
to
believe
loutchansky
came
once
to
meet
the
president
and
was
invited
again
without
giving
some
benefit
or
receiving
some
