hydrology
introduction
the
cryosphere
is
a
major
component
of
the
hydrosphere
and
interacts
significantly
with
the
global
climate
system
the
geosphere
and
the
biosphere
over
percent
of
the
earth
s
land
surface
is
covered
seasonally
by
snow
and
about
percent
is
covered
permanently
with
snow
or
ice
snow
and
ice
play
important
interactive
roles
in
regional
climates
because
snow
has
a
higher
albedo
than
any
other
natural
surface
the
earliest
signs
of
global
climate
change
are
likely
in
the
polar
regions
and
in
the
seasonal
snow
cover
and
alpine
glaciers
for
investigations
in
hydrology
and
land
surface
climatology
seasonal
snow
cover
and
alpine
glaciers
are
critical
to
the
radiation
and
water
balances
over
major
portions
of
the
middle
and
high
latitudes
and
at
high
elevations
in
the
tropical
latitudes
snow
and
alpine
glaciers
are
the
largest
contributors
to
runoff
in
rivers
and
to
ground
water
recharge
the
dual
problems
of
estimating
both
the
quantity
of
water
held
by
seasonal
snow
packs
and
timing
of
snowmelt
confront
snow
hydrologists
understanding
the
processes
in
the
seasonal
snow
cover
is
also
important
for
studies
of
the
chemical
balance
of
alpine
drainage
basins
because
of
translocation
of
anions
and
cations
within
the
snow
pack
and
possible
concentrated
release
in
the
first
phases
of
the
melt
season
soil
moisture
is
an
environmental
descriptor
that
integrates
much
of
the
land
surface
hydrology
and
is
the
interface
for
interaction
between
the
solid
earth
surface
and
life
as
central
as
this
seems
to
man
s
existence
and
biogeochemical
cycles
it
is
a
descriptor
that
has
not
had
wide
spread
application
as
a
variable
in
any
land
process
models
there
are
two
primary
reasons
for
this
it
is
a
difficult
variable
to
measure
not
at
one
point
in
time
but
in
a
consistent
and
spatially
comprehensive
basis
also
it
exhibits
very
large
spatial
and
temporal
variability
thus
point
measurements
have
had
very
little
meaning
the
practical
result
of
this
is
that
soil
moisture
has
not
been
used
as
measurable
variable
in
any
of
our
current
hydrologic
climatic
agricultural
or
biogeochemical
models
both
passive
microwave
and
active
microwave
sar
techniques
have
provided
solid
theoretical
and
experimental
results
that
the
top
five
cm
of
soil
moisture
can
be
measured
from
aircraft
and
space
platforms
under
a
variety
of
environmental
conditions
and
through
a
moderate
vegetation
cover

the
progress
to

and

the
research
still
needed
to
take
this
technology
to
an
operational
status
background
the
scientific
objectives
related
to
snow
and
ice
identified
by
the
national
research
council
are
to
study
the
global
hydrologic
cycle
to
determine
the
distributions
dimensions
properties
and
relevant
dynamics
of
snow
sea
and
lake
ice
ice
sheets
and

to
determine
and
understand
the
mechanisms
for
the
transfers
of
water
between
the
major
global
reservoirs
glacier
flow
melting
and
freezing
to
predict
on
appropriate
time
scales
the
distributions
volumes
and
fluxes
associated
with
snow
cover
sea
ice
ice
sheets
and
shelves
ground
ice
and
permafrost
although
snow
and
ice
phenomena
play
important
roles
in
global
processes
difficult
access
hampers
data
collection
and
conventional
studies
of
snow
and
ice
cannot
address
the
correct
scales
of
most
phenomena
in
situ
sampling
methods
have
limited
utility
for
capturing
the
spatial
and
temporal
variability
of
snow
and
ice
processes
operational
hydrology
and
climatology
require
timely
measurement
of
snow
pack
parameters
the
redistribution
of
solar
energy
over
the
globe
is
central
to
studies
in
climate
water
serves
a
fundamental
role
in
this
redistribution
through
the
energy
associated
with
evapotranspiration
the
transport
of
atmospheric
water
vapor
and
precipitation
residence
time
for
atmospheric
water
is
on
the
order
of
a
week
and
for
soil
moisture
from
a
couple
of
days
to
months
which
emphasize
the
active
nature
of
the
hydrologic
cycle
understanding
the
importance
of
the
land
surface
hydrology
to
climate
has
emerged
as
an
important
research
area
since
the
mid
s
when
researchers
at
the
geophysical
fluid
dynamics
laboratory
placed
a
land
hydrology
component
into
their
general
circulation
model
gcm
see
manabe
et
al
manabe
as
the
sophistication
of
gcms
has
increased
the
role
of
the
land
surface
component
has
become
more
and
more
important
however
a
major
weakness
in
the
current
gcms
is
according
to
the
ces
report
the
adequate
parameterization
of
variables
representing
the
terrestrial
phase
of
the
hydrologic
cycle
which
is
primarily
the
result
of
totally
inadequate
information
concerning
the
degree
of
spatial
variability
of
precipitation
evapotranspiration
and
other
components
of
hydrology
this
report
goes
further
to
say
the
lack
of
regional
scale
measurements
introduces
a
severe
shortcoming
in
the
testing
of
gcm
output
perhaps
the
most
important
role
that
the
land
surface
component
of
a
gcm
performs
is
the
partitioning
of
incoming
radiative
energy
into
sensible
and
latent
heat
fluxes
the
major
factor
involved
in
determining
the
relative
proportions
of
the
two
heat
fluxes
is
the
availability
of
water
generally
in
the
form
of
soil
moisture
a
number
of
modeling
studies
have
demonstrated
the
sensitivity
of
soil
moisture
anomalies
to
climate
walker
and
rowntree
rowntree
and
bolton
rind
shukla
and
mintz
delworth
and
manabe
researchers
have
reported
for
instance
that
soil
moisture
is
the
second
most
important
forcing
function
second
only
to
the
sea
surface
temperature
in
the
mid
latitudes
and
it
becomes
the
most
important
forcing
function
in
the
summer
months
the
role
of
soil
moisture
is
equally
important
at
smaller
scales
recent
studies
with
mesoscale
atmospheric
models
have
similarly
demonstrated
a
sensitivity
to
spatial
gradients
of
soil
moisture
for
example
fast
and
mccorcle
have
shown
that
soil
moisture
gradients
can
induce
thermally
induced
circulations
similar
to
sea
breezes
chang
and
wetzel
have
concluded
that
the
spatial
variations
of
vegetation
and
soil
moisture
affect
the
surface
baroclinic
structures
through
differential
heating
which
in
turn
indicate
the
location
and
intensity
of
surface
dynamic
and
thermodynamic
discontinuities
necessary
to
develop
severe
storms
in
yet
another
study
lanicci
et
al
have
shown
that
dry
soil
conditions
over
northern
mexico
and
variable
soil
moisture
conditions
over
the
southern
great
plains
can
dynamically
interact
to
alter
prestorm
conditions
and
subsequent
convective
rainfall
patterns
it
is
still
unclear
whether
the
spatial
distribution
of
soil
moisture
collected
at
regional
scales
is
useful
for
gcm
and
mesoscale
modeling
one
indication
in
favor
is
the
recent
study
by
betts
et
al
showing
that
initialization
of
ecmwf
weather
predictions
on
current
soil
moisture
during
the
summer
of
in
the
us
great
plains
region
can
lead
to
improved
rainfall
predictions
the
extreme
wetness
conditions
in
comparison
to
climatological
average
soil
moisture
clearly
was
a
factor
in
the
effect
for
more
normal
conditions
soil
moisture
anomalies
will
vary
with
the
spatial
and
temporal
scales
of
rain
events
scales
that
may
be
meaningful
to
dimensional
data
assimilations
dda
and
mesoscale
modeling
based
on
these
studies
and
scales
ranging
from
gcm
to
mesoscale
it
appears
that
soil
moisture
will
be
an
important
hydrologic
variable
for
hydrometeorological
modeling
and
validation
studies
because
of
the
ubiquitous
nature
of
soil
moisture
in
many
disciplines
there
are
numerous
potential
science
applications
for
frequent
and
spatially
comprehensive
measurements
of
soil
moisture
however
most
of
these
will
fit
under
the
umbrella
of
the
following
four
science
issues
which
are
the
highest
priority
to
understand
the
role
of
surface
soil
moisture
in
the
partitioning
of
incoming
radiant
energy
into
latent
and
sensible
heat
fluxes
at
a
variety
of
scales
from
mesoscale
to
gcm
scale
to
understand
the
relationship
between
the
surface
cm
of
soil
moisture
observable
by
microwave
techniques
and
the
total
profile
m
or
more
soil
moisture
that
is
accessible
to
plants
and
transpiration
to
the
atmosphere
to
understand
how
spatial
and
temporal
patterns
of
soil
moisture
are
related
to
the
physical
and
hydrologic
properties
of
soils
to
understand
how
the
spatial
and
temporal
patterns
of
soil
moisture
can
be
used
to
improve
our
ability
to
model
runoff
at
a
variety
of
scales
and
adapt
hydrologic
models
to
areas
of
differing
climate
biomes
and
soils
and
geology
with
the
potential
for
measuring
soil
moisture
having
been
demonstrated
the
obvious
question
to
ask
is
how
might
society
use
such
soil
moisture
measurements
as
in
the
science
issues
there
are
four
general
areas
in
which
routine
measurements
of
soil
moisture
could
have
major
impacts
on
our
day
to
day
lives
improvements
in
medium
range
weather
forecasting
by
incorporating
measured
soil
moisture
on
a
km
grid
on
a
daily
basis
agricultural
applications
would
include
on
farm
uses
for
improving
irrigation
scheduling
and
efficiencies
to
improving
crop
yield
modeling
for
both
domestic
and
foreign
areas
the
scales
of
interest
here
would
be
m
to
km
and
three
to
seven
days
water
management
applications
require
better
quantification
of
water
uses
storages
and
runoff
to
monitor
existing
resources
and
to
assist
decision
makers
in
allocation
of
limited
resources
or
coordination
of
relief
efforts
in
times
of
flooding
the
scales
of
interest
here
would
also
be
m
to
km
and
three
to
seven
days
climate
models
particularly
for
annual
and
inter
annual
variability
need
to
be
able
to
represent
the
land
surface
hydrologic
processes
accurately
measured
soil
moisture
can
be
used
as
a
state
variable
and
as
a
validity
measure
for
gcms
the
scales
of
interest
here
are
to
km
and
to

role
of
sar
satellite
remote

has
become
increasingly
important
to
hydrologists
and
climatologists
because
the
data
provide
information
on

of

of

importance

remote
sensing
improves
the
monitoring
of
existing
conditions
and
has
been
incorporated
into
several
runoff
forecasting
and
management
systems
visible
and
near
infrared
sensors
have
been
used
extensively
to
measure
snow
covered
area
while
the
signal
in
this
portion
of
the
electromagnetic
spectrum
is
sensitive
to
snow
grain
size
and
impurities
it
is
not
sensitive
to
wetness
and
is
sensitive
to
water
equivalence
only
for
shallow
snow
packs
in
addition
cloud
cover
hampers
data
collection
from
these
sensors
so
the
opportunities
for
obtaining
suitable
data
can
be
infrequent
in
addition
to
accurate
measurements
of
snow
extent
and
albedo
forecasting
of
melt
at
both
continental
and
drainage
basin
scales
requires
information
about
spatial
and
temporal
distributions
of
snow
water
equivalence
and
free
liquid

content
passive
microwave
signals
are
sensitive
to
snow
properties
of
hydrologic
interest
however
the
spatial
resolution
of
spaceborne
passive
microwave
sensors
is
much
coarser
than
the
natural
scale
of
variation
in
mountainous
areas
active

major

to

put
capabilities
for

at

doorstep

recent

have
shown
a
significant
improvement
in

now
compare

with
those
derived

which
require
clear

and

for
soil
moisture
recent
advances
in
remote
sensing
technology
have
demonstrated
that
soil
moisture
can
be
measured
by
a
variety
of
techniques
however
only
microwave
technology
has
the
ability
to
quantitatively
measure
soil
moisture
under
a
variety
of
topographic
and
vegetation
cover
conditions
so
potentially
it
could
be
extended
to
routine
measurements
from
a
satellite
system
a
number
of
experiments
using
sensors
mounted
in
trucks
aircraft
and
spacecraft
have
shown
that
the
moisture
within
a
thin
layer
of
soil
on
the
order
of
cm
can
be
accurately
measured
for
bare
soil
and
thinly
vegetated
surfaces
soil
moisture
remote
sensing
there
are
two
basic
microwave
approaches
that
are
typically
used
to
measure
soil
moisture
one
is
passive
which
is
based
on
radiometry
and
the
other
is
active
and
uses
radar
both
approaches
utilize
the
large
contrast
between
the
dielectric
constant
of
dry
soil
and
water
at
l
band
the
dielectric
constant
can
vary
from
about
for
dry
soil
to
about
for
wet
soil
which
can
result
in
a
change
in
emissivity
for
passive
systems
from
about
to
or
lower
and
an
increase
in
the
radar
backscatter
approaching
db
there
are
also
major
differences
between
the
two
systems
in
spatial
resolution
swath
width
data
rate
and
power
requirements
however
almost
without
exception
the
two
systems
are
complementary
that
is
strengths
in
one
are
matched
by
weaknesses
in
the
other
and
vice
versa
the
advantages
of
passive
microwave
systems
include
frequent
coverage
low
data
rates
and
relative
to
active
microwave
simpler
data
processing
the
disadvantages
include
poor
resolution
in
the
case
of
the
active
microwave
systems
the
advantages
include
high
resolution
but
this
comes
at
the
expense
of
higher
data
rates
and
more
complex
processing
measurements
show
that
the
estimated
soil
moisture
for
l
band
frequencies
correlate
best
with
soil
moistures
in
the
top
cm
of
the
soil
the
sensitivity
of
active
microwave
sensors
to
soil
moisture
was
demonstrated
with
many
ground
airborne
and
even
some
spaceborne
experiments

et
al
must
still
be
further
evaluated
over
a
broader
range
of
conditions
difficulties
in
soil
moisture
remote
sensing
a
significant
difficulty
in
remotely
sensing
soil
moisture
either
with
active
and
passive
systems
is
the
effect
of
target
characteristics
other
than
the
soil
moisture
for
example
surface
roughness
vegetation
and
topography
the
two
most
important
target
properties
are
surface
roughness
and
those
related
to
the
vegetation
canopy
applying
a
backscattering
model
lin
et
al
have
studied
the
sensitivity
of
radar
signals
to
various
land
surface
parameters
specifically
for
l
band
ghz
over
a
short
grass
canopy
they
found
that
the
most
important
parameter
appears
to
be
the
surface
roughness
in
most
natural
settings
the
effect
of
roughness
may
be
equal
or
greater
than
the
effect
of
soil
moisture
on
the
radar
backscatter
thus
the
soil
moisture
problem
becomes
one
of
determining
the
roughness
effect
independently
so
that
a
model
can
be
inverted
to
yield
a
soil
moisture
estimate
surface
roughness
effects
improved
understanding
of
surface
scattering
processes
is
needed
to
further
our
understanding
of
the
role
of
surface
roughness
in
soil
moisture
estimation
thus
theoretical
surface
backscattering
models
have
been
developed
for
this
purpose
namely
the
small
perturbation
model
spm
the
physical
optics
model
pom
and
geometrical
optics
model
gom
in
a
broad
sense
the
geometrical
optics
model
is
best
suited
for
very
rough
surface
the
physical
optics
model
is
suitable
for
surfaces
with
intermediate
scales
of
roughness
and
the
small
perturbation
model
is
suitable
for
smooth
surfaces
in
general
these
models
have
not
provided
good
predictive
values
in
field
scale
observed
soil
moisture
and
more
research
is
needed
into
surface
scattering
models
examples
of
recent
work
are
fung
et
al
and
oh
et
al
the
approach
adopted
by
oh
et
al
is
based
on
scattering
behavior
in
limiting
cases
and
on
experimental
data
they
have
developed
an
empirical
model
in
terms
of
the
root
mean
square
rms
roughness
height
the
wave
number
and
the
relative
dielectric
constant
by
using
this
model
with
multipolarized
radar
data
the
soil
moisture
content
and
the
surface
roughness
can
be
determined
the
key
to
this
approach
is
that
the
co

which
are
given
explicitly
in

of
the

and
the

in
more
recent
work
dubois
et
al
an
algorithm
was
derived
that
uses
l
band
hh
and
vv
radar
cross
sections
only
to
estimate
surface
roughness
and
soil
moisture
in
this
case
the
algorithm
was
tested
with
both
airborne
and
spaceborne

data
and
accuracies
of
absolute
was
found
for
surfaces
with
vegetation
that
has
a
normalized

vegetation
index
ndvi
vegetation
effects
the
effect
of
vegetation
is
to
attenuate
the
microwave
emission
from
the
soil
it
also
adds
to
the
total
radiative
flux
with
its
own
emission
the
degree
to
which
vegetation
affects
the
determination
of
soil
moisture
depends
upon
the
wavelength
the
mass
and
water
content
of
vegetation
and
the
vegetation
s
structural
characteristics
as
it
influences
its
scattering
properties
thus
with
radar
the
effect
of
the
vegetation
canopy
adds
more
complexity
to
the
problem
to
infer
soil
moisture
one
must
determine
the
soil
roughness
effects
and
the
effects
of
the
vegetation
canopy
which
is
a
complex
inference
problem
and
may
not
be
unique
without
high
temporal
resolution
data
in
which
only
soil
moisture
is
changing
as
with
the
roughness
case
the
effect
of
vegetation
on
the
active
microwave
sensing
of
soil
moisture
is
greatly
dependent
upon
the
instrument
incidence
angle
frequency
and
polarization
the
vegetation
contains
water
along
and
has
plant
structure
radar
backscatter
is
sensitive
to
both
of
these
characteristics
lin
et
al
a
therefore
the
radar
backscatter
from
a
vegetated
surface
will
have
the
integrated
effect
of
the
vegetation
and
underlying
soil
two
general
approaches
have
been
used
to
model
the
volume
scattering
the
wave
approach
and
the
intensity
or
radiative
transfer
approach
both
approaches
have
their
constraints
especially
in
dealing
with
complex
vegetation
structures
several
groups
are
involved
in
research
in
the
area
of
estimating
soil
moisture
from
active
microwave
data
in
the
presence
of
vegetation
few
results
have
been
presented
or
published
however
saatchi
et
al
showed
that
by
using
c
band
and
l
band
data
the
canopy
water
content
of
grasses
in
the
konza
prairie
could
be
estimated
with
an
accuracy
of
about
while
lin
et
al
reported
an
accuracy
of
about
when
estimating
soil
moisture
over
grass
covered
areas
in
england
assuming
that
the
effects
of
vegetation
could
be
accounted
for
in
the
case
of
active
microwave
sensors
and
given
the
fact
that
the
best
resolution
than
could
be
expected
from
a
spaceborne
low
frequency
radiometer
is
on
the
order
of
tens
of
kilometers
it
is
clear
that
sar
can
play
an
important
role
in
providing
remotely
sensed
surface
soil
moisture
maps
the
optimum
radar
parameters
based
on
the
demonstrated
algorithms
would
be
a
polarimetric
l
band
radar
system
with
a
resolution
on
the
order
of
m
there
is
evidence
that
suggests
that
inferring
soil
moisture
in
vegetated
areas
would
require
some
higher
frequency
sar
data
either
c
band
or
x
band
continued
research
is
needed
to
help
resolve
the
effectiveness
of
radar
data
for
soil
moisture
under
different
vegetation
types
and
densities
one
approach
is
using
multi
temporal
data
from
a
satellite
platform
which
may
provide
the
long
term
data
sets
necessary
to
isolate
the
fast
changing
soil
moisture
effects
from
the
slowly
changing
vegetation
and
roughness
effects
another
promising
approach
is
combining
the
sar
radar
measurements
with
a
distributed
hydrologic
models
to
infer
soil
moisture
for
example
lin
et

b
field
measurements
of
soil
moisture
when
deciding
the
usefulness
of
the
remote
sensing
instruments
and
the
inferred
soil
moisture
estimates
one
has
to
take
into
account
the
natural
spatial
variability
of
soil
moisture
thus
when
estimating
the
accuracy
of
a
technique
estimated
and
in
situ
measured
values
are
typically
compared
in
this
way
areal
averages
from
the
remotely
sensed
data
are
compared
to
point
measurements
and
the
natural
variation
in
the
measured
quantity
becomes
a
very
important
factor
in
judging
the
performance
of
a
given
technique
in
most
countries
there
are
a
number
of
in
situ
soil
moisture
measurements
taken
in
support
of
operational
activities
related
to
agriculture
two
examples
of
such
measurements
programs
are
the
illinois
state
u
s
soil
moisture
program
an
site
measurement
network
in
operation
since
and
the
long
term
soil
moisture
measurements
in
the
former
soviet
union
and
reported
by
vinnikov
and
yeserkepova
typically
these
measurements
are
taken
using
a
neutron
probe
time
domain
reflectivity
td
instrument
or
through
labor
intensive
techniques
such
as
gravimetric
measurements
also
typically
these
are
made
on
a
three
day
weekly
or
longer
basis
and
in
some
cases
for
agricultural
experiments
only
during
the
growing
season
for
example
the
current
illinois
network
makes
biweekly
samples
during
the
growing
season
and
monthly
samples
at
other
times
the
data
reported
by
vinnikov
and
yeserkepova
were
sampled
at
a
monthly
time
interval
the
in
situ
measurements
generally
provide
good
definition
with
depth
usually
consisting
of
measurements
every
or
cm
throughout
the
root
zone
to
depths
of
one
to
two
meters
thus
the
profile
is
well
defined
but
there
is
usually
not
an
extensive
spatial
sampling
to
detect
soil
moisture
gradients
in
the
horizontal
plane
a
number
of
investigators
have
looked
into
the
spatial
variability
of
soil
properties
rogowski
found
that
over
a
range
of
soils
that
the
coefficient
of
variation
in
the
distribution
of
water
content
at
bars
was
in
the
range
of
to
and
for
experimental
hydraulic
conductivity
was
to
hawley
et
al
investigated
the
effect
of
sample
volume
on
estimated
soil
moisture
content
using
a
m
square
plot
and
samples
the
estimated
cv
was
in
the
range
of
for
the
three
different
soil
moisture
conditions
investigated
implying
a
cv
of
for
a
single
sample
which
is
consistent
with
the
other
similar
studies
in
addition
they
concluded
that
samples
greater
than
g
cc
are
needed
for
accurate
estimates
field
scale
variability
ha
acres
was
evaluated
by
bell
et
al
using
data
collected
in
fields
in
arizona
kansas
and
south
dakota
the
nominal
standard
deviation
of
all
the
data
analyzed
was
between
and
soil
moisture
for
remote
sensing
studies
this
means
that
perfect
correlations
to
ground
observations
are
unlikely
and
that
the
inherent
error
due
to
field
scale
variability
is
of
the
same
order
of
magnitude
as
the
demonstrated
accuracies
of
the
inversion
results
for
both
active
and
passive
microwave
instruments
while
there
are
direct
uses
for
the
surface
soil
moistures
a
much
wider
range
of
research
and
applications
would
benefit
from
an
estimate
of
the
profile
soil
moisture
although
there
is
still
much
work
to
be
done
in
this
area
some
basic
concepts
have
been
proven
kostov
and
jackson
kostov
have
identified
four
general
approaches
statistical
knowledge
based
a
priori
information
radiometric
inversion
and
soil
water
modeling
regional
profile
mapping
using
a
straightforward
regression
approach
was
demonstrated
in
jackson
et
al
knowledge
based
approaches
have
been
used
extensively
by
reutov
and
shutko
and
and
also
by
jackson
recent
research
has
focused
on
a
combination
of
the
inversion
and
modeling
approaches
entekhabi
et
al
each
of
these
approaches
needs
to
be
considered
in
the
development
of
large
scale
mapping
programs
because
any
one
in
particular
may
not
be
compatible
due
to
limitations
caused
by
ancillary
data
requirements
or
the
temporal
and
spatial
sampling
radar
observations
for
soil
moisture
sar
satellites
offer
perhaps
the
best
opportunity
to
measure
soil
moisture
routinely
at
regional
scales
currently
the

jers
l

sars
are
operating
and
the
canadian
radarsat
also
c

hh
will
be
launched
in
mid
although
it
is
believed
that
an
l
band
polarimetric
system
would
be
optimal
for
soil
moisture
the
preliminary
results
from
the
ers
demonstrate
its
capability
as
a
soil
moisture
instrument
under
ideal
conditions
bare
soil
near

constant
roughness
the
main
drawback
to
the
sar
systems
is
the
lack
of
existing
algorithms
for
the
routine
determination
of
soil
moisture
however
through
airborne
and
sir
c
remote
sensing
experiments
field
observations
are
accumulating
for
a
diverse
set
of
sites
it
is
hoped
that
these
data
are
sufficient
for
developing
suitable
algorithms
it
is
critical
that
these
diverse
data
sets
be
brought
together
in
a
sar
soil

data
base
experimental
data
sets
can
be
grouped
into
three
classes
of
which
only
one
is
discussed
in
this
report
these

are

in

taken
by
water
resources
and
agricultural
agencies
for
a
variety
of
reasons
even
though
these
data
sets
are
important
for
hydrological
research
the
lack
of
simultaneous
remote

make
these

of
limited
value
for

current

and
their

several
methods
for

have
been
developed
and
tested
using
airsar
and
ers
imagery
mapping
wet
snow
and
glaciers
in
remote
alpine
regions
using
a
conventional
single

single

sar

requires
an
accurate

of

ers

showed
significant
improvement
in

accuracy
and
corresponding
decrease
in
the
need
for
a
dem
however
the
capability
of
a
single
polarization
sar
to
study
alpine
snow
is
limited
to
map
wet
snow
cover
only
furthermore
multi
frequency
multi
polarization
sar
can
effectively
map
the
extent
of
wet
snow
regions
without
requiring
any
topographic
information
numerical
simulations
show
that
a
similar
technique
could
map
dry
snow
cover
verification
is
ongoing
thus
a
multi
frequency
polarized
sar
provides
snow
mapping
capability
from
small
to
large

sir
c

sar
also
can
map
firn

which
indicates
the
regions
of
annual
snow
accumulation
or
of

this
capability
provides
an
important
tool
for
mass
balance
studies
of

the
most
fundamental
snow
cover
property
in
terms
of
water
supply
forecasting
is
the
snow
water
equivalence
the
total
amount
of
water
the
snow
would
yield
at
a

if

melted
this
variable
has
been
traditionally
measured
at
several
hundred
snow
courses
throughout
the
mountainous
regions
of
the
western
u
s
how
to
extrapolate
these
widely
dispersed
measurements
remains
a
fundamental
problem
in
estimating
the
total
water
volume
in
the
mountains
numerical

shown
it

of

detection
of

and
the
measurement
of
the
spatial

we
will
better
understand
the
most
fundamental
problems
in
snow
hydrology
the
spatial
and
temporal
distributions
of
snow
properties
in
alpine
regions
to
derive
the
maximum
benefit
in
terms
of
research
or
application
out
of
remotely
sensed
soil
moisture
the
remote
sensing
data
must
be
integrated
into
a
geographic
information
system
and
analyzed
taking
into
account
the
soil
properties
and
land
characteristics
therefore
the
required
resolution
of
the
remotely
sensed
soil
moisture
data
is
related
to
the
intended
usage
and
the
ancillary
data
bases
available
for
interpretation
it
makes
little
sense
to
collect
data
globally
at
a
resolution
much
higher
than
that
of
the
ancillary
data
it
therefore
appears
that
based
on
the
range
of
projected
applications
and
the
available
ancillary
data
bases
that
a
spatial
resolution
on
the
order
of
m
to
m
may
be
advantageous
for
processing
and
interpretation
it
is
true
that
the
detail
offered
in
higher
resolution
sar
data
is
interesting
however
it
does
not
seem
to
be
really
needed
except
for
mapping
and
other
less
time
critical
analyses
the
timing
and
frequency
of
observation
are
very
important
in
the
valuation
of
the
remote
sensing
data
for
application
and
analysis
surface
soil
moisture
is
diurnal
in
nature
generally
decreasing
during
the
day
and
rising
slightly
at
night
in
the
absence
of
precipitation
the
time
of
the
observation
will
most
certainly
be
considered
in
its
use
certain
times
of
the
day
may
offer
certain
advantages
for
instance
to
extrapolate
a
surface
observation
to
the
profile
using
a
physically
based
approach
jackson
has
shown
that
a
predawn
observation
is
advantageous
in
fact
late
afternoon
observations
of
surface
soil
moisture
using
shorter
wavelengths
may
provide
little
to
no
information
an
improvement
in
this
single
observation
could
be
made
by
utilizing
diurnal
changes
an
a
m
and
a
p
m
observation
for
bare
soils
this
could
provide
a
good
estimate
of
the
total
surface
flux
during
the
day
frequency
of
coverage
is
a
much
more
difficult
subject
of
course
this
too
is
dependent
on
the
application
it
seems
that
daily
coverage
would
be
of
greatest
value
for
all
regions
there
is
a
significant
sacrifice
in
increasing
this
however
the
next
plateau
would
be
three
days
observations
at
lower
frequencies
might
only
be
of
selected
value
given
this
sampling
requirement
and
the
previous
experimental
results
it
is
clear
that
the
currently
planned
international
sars
can
provide
little
beyond
change
detection
for
changing
moisture
conditions
and
mapping
of
wet
alpine
snow
cover
only
recommendations
the
recent
results
indicating
that
soil
moisture
and
snow
water
equivalence
could
indeed
be
measured
accurately
with
spaceborne
multiparameter
sars
bring
the
remote
sensing
one
step
closer
to
providing
some
important
variables
to
help
understand
and
routinely
monitor
the
hydrologic
cycle
however
even
though
the
status
of
sar
for
measuring
these
quantities
is
very
promising
it
is
recognized
that
there
are
a
number
of
logical
steps
to
be
taken
in
order
for
the
general
scientific
and
public
communities
to
benefit
from
this
research
given
the
previous
experimental
results
and
the
recent
algorithms
derived
to
infer
soil
moisture
and
snow
water
equivalence
it
is
clear
that
single
frequency
sars
can
provide
little
beyond
change
detection
for
changing
moisture
conditions
it
is
highly
doubtful
whether
even
the
magnitude
of
the
change
in
the
soil
moisture
could
be
quantified
from
these
types
of
single
parameter
sar
measurements
without
a
significant
number
of
risky
assumptions
therefore
the
logical
conclusion
is
that
the
ultimate
goal
should
certainly
be
an
operational
spaceborne
multiparameter
sar
for
routine
soil
moisture
and
snow
water
equivalence
mapping
recognizing
that
this
is
not
likely
to
happen
soon
we
therefore
urge
the
continued
support
of
the
nasa
multiparameter
airborne
sar
program
as
a
vehicle
to
continue
the
development
and
validation
of
soil
moisture
snow
wetness
and
snow
water
equivalence
algorithms
in
the
short
term
with
the
long
term
goal
the
definition
and
launch
of
an
operational
sar
to
monitor
these
important
variables
of
the
hydrologic
cycle
below
we
outline
a
few
steps
we
consider
necessary
to
achieve
this
goal
combine
all
data
collected
during
airsar
and
sir
c
x
sar
campaigns
and
analyze
their
ability
to
determine
soil
moisture
empirically
sigma
