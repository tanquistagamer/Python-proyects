reflect
changes
in
snow
cover
between
the
two
missions
the
april
mission
occurred
immediately
following
a
moderate
snow
storm
during
the
mission
the
snow
evolved
from
a
dry
fine
grained
snowpack
with
few
distinct
layers
to
a
wet
coarse
grained
pack
with
multiple
ice
inclusions
since
that
mission
all
snow
in
the
area
has
melted
except
for
small
glaciers
and
permanent
snowfields
on
the
silver
divide
and
near
the
headwaters
of
rock
creek
on
october
only
discontinuous
patches
of
snow
cover
were
present
at
very
high
elevations
following
the
first
snow
storm
of
the
season
on
september
for
investigations
in
hydrology
and
land
surface
climatology
seasonal
snow
cover
and
alpine
glaciers
are
critical
to
the
radiation
and
water
balances
sir
c
x
sar
is
a
powerful
tool
because
it
is
sensitive
to
most
snowpack
conditions
and
is
less
influenced
by
weather
conditions
than
other
remote
sensing
instruments
such
as
landsat
in
parallel
with
the

an
experimental

is
being
conducted
to

using
the

laboratory
s

facility
centered

these

will
assess
the
abilities
of

to
produce
high
