our
study
focuses
on
the
use
of
sar
to
study
windblown
processes
including
sand
and
dust
storms
we
are
using
sar
to
estimate
the
aerodynamic
properties
of
a
surface
this
is
an
important
parameter
in
climate
modeling
the
threshold
windspeed
for
sand
and
dust
transport
and
other
boundary
layer
models
