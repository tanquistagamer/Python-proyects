this

s
jurisdictional
statement
introduction
during
much
of
this
century
the
mass
media
has
been
characterized
by
a
limited
number
of
speakers
transmitting
programming
and
information
to
essentially
passive
audiences
the
communications
medium
of
the
twenty
first
century
the
internet
and
cyberspace
generally
is
changing
that
and
will
allow
hundreds
of
millions
of
individuals
to
engage
in
interactive
communication
on
a
national
and
global
scale
never
before
possible
the
public
square
of
the
past
with
pamphleteering
soap
boxes
and
vigorous
debate
is
being
replaced
by
the
internet
which
enables
average
citizens
to
participate
in
national
discourse
publish
a
newspaper
distribute
an
electronic
pamphlet
to
the
world
and
generally
to
communicate
to
and
with
a
broader
audience
than
ever
before
possible
it
also
enables
average
citizens
to
gain
access
to
a
vast
and
literally
world
wide
range
of
information

communications
decency
act

cda
quot
or
the
quot
act

represents
congress
first
attempt
to
regulate
speech
content
in
this
promising
new
medium
unfortunately
congress
undertook
this
task
without
holding
any
hearings
regarding
the
likely
impact
of
the
cda
on
that
medium
in
the
name
of
protecting
children
from
inappropriate
material
they
might
encounter
online
congress
clumsily
attempted
to
graft
regulations
developed
in
the
quot
dial
a
porn
quot
context
onto
this
very
different
indeed
unique
mode
of
communication
after
making
precisely
the
kind
of
inquiry
congress
failed
to
make
that
is
undertaking
five
days
of
evidentiary
hearings
and
considering
massive
amounts
of
documentary
evidence
including
extensive
stipulated
facts
the
three
judge
district
court
below
preliminarily
enjoined
enforcement
of
provisions
of
the
cda
that
effectively
ban
quot
indecent
quot
and
quot
patently
offensive
quot
communications
between
adults
appendix
to
jurisdictional
statement
quot
j
s
app
quot
a
a
the
district
court
unanimously
held
that
appellees
are
likely
to
succeed
in
their
claim
that
this
ban
violates
the
first
amendment
that
judgment
was
clearly
correct
nevertheless
appellees
appreciate
that
this
case
raises
important
constitutional
questions
regarding
the
application
of
traditional
first
amendment
principles
to
a
new
and
increasingly
important
medium
of
communication
and
therefore
recognize
that
the
court
is
likely
to
grant
plenary
review
regardless
of
the
strength
of
the
district
court
s
decision
although
we
believe
the
judgment
below
could
be
summarily
affirmed
we
understand
that
in
this
case
of
first
impression
the
court
may
prefer
to
engage
in
a
more
comprehensive
examination
of
this
new
medium
and
of
the
extensive
record
compiled
below
we
agree
that
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case
plenary
review
may
be
appropriate
even
if
as
we
believe
the
judgment
below
is
plainly
correct
accordingly
we
do
not
oppose
the
government
s
request
for
plenary
review
however
we
do
believe
it
is
particularly
important
in
this
case
of
first
impression
that
the
court
have
a
clear
understanding
of
precisely
what
was
argued
and
decided
below
for
example
the
government
did
not
argue
below
as
it
apparently
does
here
that
sections
a
b
and
d
a
of
the
cda
criminalize
quot
indecent
quot
or
quot
patently
offensive
quot
speech
only
when
the
speaker
knows
that
the
only
recipients
of
the
speech
are
all
under
years
of
age
moreover
the
government
s
jurisdictional
statement
frequently
ignores
dispositive
findings
of
fact
the
government
does
not
argue
are
erroneous

we
submit

the

the

to
acknowledge
the

critical
factual
findings
that
it
is
impossible
or
infeasible
for
most
internet
speakers
to
comply
with
the
cda
s
affirmative
defenses
because
of
the
global
nature
of
the
internet
the
cda
will
not
effectively
shield
minors
from
indecent
or
patently
offensive
speech
since
a
very
substantial
percentage
of
such
speech
is
posted
abroad
and
will
not
be
deterred
by
the
cda
and
parents
can
use
currently
available
software
and

options
to
control
what

may
access
these
findings
undergird
the
district
court
s
legal
conclusions
that
the
act
effectively
bans
constitutionally
protected
speech
among
adults
would
not
substantially
further
the
government
s
stated
interest
in
shielding
minors
from
indecent
online
speech
and
is
not
the
least
restrictive
means
available
to
serve
the
government
s
interest
impossibility
and
infeasibility
of
compliance
the
district
court
received
extensive
evidence
from
numerous
experts
and
other
witnesses
and
carefully
considered
the
different
methods
of
communication
over
the
internet
based
on
this
body
of
evidence
the
court
made
its
general
factual
finding
that
quot
o
nce
a
provider
posts
content
on
the
internet
it
is
available
to
all
other
internet
users
worldwide
quot
j
s
app
a
for
most
methods
of
communication
over
the
internet
the
court
concluded
that
it
simply
is
not
possible
for
a
speaker
to
restrict
the
availability
of
his
or
her
speech
to
adults
for
example
the
district
court
specifically
considered
the
ability
of
a
speaker
posting
a
message
to
a
usenet
newsgroup
to
comply
with
the
cda
the
court
found
that
messages
on
newsgroups
are
quot
disseminated
using
ad
hoc
peer
to
peer
connections
between
approximately
computers
called
usenet
servers
around
the
world
quot
j
s
app
a
and
that
the
quot
dissemination
of
messages
to
usenet
servers
around
the
world
is
an
automated
process
that
does
not
require
direct
human
intervention
or
review
quot
id
at
a
a
because
of
this
structure
the
court
found
as
a
fact
that
quot
once
a
user
posts
a
message
to
a
newsgroup
that
message
becomes
available
to
all
subscribers
to
that
newsgroup
or
bulletin
board

the

available
not

also
in
provo
and
prague
quot
id
at

the
court
specifically
further
found
that

to

cannot
ensure
that
all

are

id
at
a

the
same
conclusions
about
e
mail

exploders
also
known
as
listservs

rooms

the
court
found
as
a

there

no
effective
way
to

of

id
at

based
its
finding
that

engaging

discussions
cannot
ensure
that
all

are

quot
in
part
on
the
fact
that

agreed

similarly
with

as
a
fact
that

id
at
a
with
respect
to
the
world
wide
web
which
is
one
method
of
communication

there
does

interrogate
a

web
site

using
a
computer
program
called

the

found
as
a

online
services
cannot

the
court
concluded
that
all

are
effectively
unavailable

and
these

constitute
the

of

see

at

for
example
the
distinct
court
found
as
a
fact
that

is
effectively
unavailable
to
a
substantial
number
of

content
providers
as
a
potential
defense
to
the

quot
id
at
a
the
district
court
similarly
considered
the
quot
adult
verification
quot
defense
and
found
as
a
fact
that
the
quot
burdens
imposed
by
credit
card
verification
and
adult
password
verification
systems
make
them
effectively
unavailable
to
a
substantial
number
of
internet
content
providers
quot
id
at
a
finally
the
district
court
found
as
a
fact
that
the
government
s
quot
tagging
quot
proposal
would
not
allow
a
speaker
to
ensure
that
a
listener
is
not
a
minor
id
at
a
a
chief
judge
sloviter
summarized
the
court
s
factual
conclusions
as
follows
we
have
found
that
no
technology
exists
which
allows
those
posting
protected
but
indecent
material
on
the
category
of
newsgroups
mail
exploders
or
chat
rooms
to
screen
for
age
speakers
using
those
forms
of
communication
cannot
control
who
receives
the
communication
and
in
most
instances
are
not
aware
of
the
identity
of
the
recipients
if
it
is
not
feasible
for
speakers
who
communicate
via
these
forms
of
communication
to
conduct
age
screening
they
would
have
to
reduce
the
level
of
communication
to
that
which
is
appropriate
for
children
in
order
to
be
protected
under
the
statute
this
would
effect
a
complete
ban
even
for
adults
of
some
expression
albeit
quot
indecent
quot
to
which
they
are
constitutionally
entitled
even
as
to
content
providers
in
the
other
broad
category
such
as
the
world
wide
web
where
efforts
at
age
verification
are
technically
feasible
through
the
use
of
common
gateway
interface
cgi
scripts
the
findings
of
fact
show
that
as
a
practical
matter
non
commercial
organizations
and
even
many
commercial
organizations
using
the
web
would
find
it
prohibitively
expensive
and
burdensome
to
engage
in
the
methods
of
age
verification
proposed
by
the
government
and
that
even
if
they
could
attempt
to
age
verify
there
is
little
assurance
that
they
could
successfully
filter
out
minors
j
s
app
a
in
their
findings
of
fact
the
three
judges
below
found
as
facts
that
many
speakers
who
display
arguably
indecent
content
on
the
internet
must
choose
between
silence
and
the
risk
of
prosecution
the
cda
s
defenses
credit
card
verification
adult
access
codes
and
adult
personal
identification
numbers
are
effectively
unavailable
for
non
commercial
not
for
profit
entities
j
s
app
a
emphasis
added
ineffectiveness
of
the
cda
the
district
court
also
made
specific
factual
findings
demonstrating
that
because
a
substantial
percentage
of
all
of
the
indecent
or
patently
offensive
speech
that
is
available
on
the
internet
is
posted
abroad
the
cda
will
not
be
effective
in
its
claimed
goal
of
preventing
children
from
accessing
that
material
the
court
found
that
a
quot
large
percentage
perhaps
or
more
quot
of
content
on
the
internet
quot
originates
outside
of
the
united
states
quot
j
s
app
a
and
some
of
that
foreign
speech
is
sexually
explicit
id
as
the
court
found
quot
f
oreign
content
is
otherwise
indistinguishable
from
domestic
content
as
long
as
it
is
in
english
since
foreign
speech
is
created
named
and
posted
in
the
same
manner
as
domestic
speech
quot
id
minors
would
have
unfettered
access
to
all
indecent
or
patently
offensive
speech
posted
abroad
and
thus
as
judge
dalzell
concluded
quot
the
cda
will
almost
certainly
fail
to
accomplish
the
government
s
interest
in
shielding
children
from
pornography
on
the
internet
quot
id
at
a
availability
of
user
software
to
block
or
screen
material
on
the
internet
finally
the
government
s
jurisdictional
statement
entirely
omits
any
mention
of
the
extensive
factual
findings
of
the
district
court
concerning
the
variety
of
methods
by
which
parents
can
easily
and
inexpensively
prevent
their
children
from
accessing
indecent
or
patently
offensive
online
content
even
if
posted
overseas
the
court
identified
many
different
and
currently
available
software
programs
that
allow
parents
to
limit
the
internet
access
of
their
children
j
s
app
a
a
similarly
the
court
found
that
the
major
online
services
all
offer
extensive
options
to
allow
parents
to
control
what
their
children
can
access
id
at
a
a
given
these
factual
findings
which
the
government
has
not
contested
it
is
clear
that
the
three
judge
district
court
correctly
held
that
plaintiffs
had
demonstrated
a
likelihood
of
success
on
their
claim
that
the
challenged
provisions
of
the
cda
violate
the
first
amendment
argument
i
the
district
court
s
preliminary
injunction
should
be
affirmed
because
the
government
has
not
contested
the
facts
on
which
that
injunction
is
based
and
does
not
ask
the
court
to
overrule
the
long
established
first
amendment
principles
on
which
that
injunction
is
based
as
noted
the
government
does
not
argue
that
the
district
court
s
findings
of
fact
are
arbitrary
or
otherwise
erroneous
nor
does
the
government
question
the
first
amendment
principles
invoked
by
the
district
court
accordingly
the
government
is
simply
challenging
the
application
of
settled
first
amendment
principles
to
undisputed
findings
of
fact
a
the
government
does
not
question
the
district
court
s
conclusion
that
the
cda
must
be
subjected
to
strict
scrutiny
the
government
does
not
dispute
that
the
district
court
appropriately
subjected
the
cda
s
content
based
restrictions
to
strict
scrutiny
see
jurisdictional
statement
quot
j
s
quot
its
sole
argument
is
that
the
act
can
be
upheld
under
strict
scrutiny
because
the
act
quot
directly
and
materially
quot
serves
a
quot
compelling
quot
government
interest
in

the

already
use

but
as
judge
dalzell
explained
these

will
be
largely
unaffected
by
the

precisely
because
they
already
require
credit
cards
to
obtain
access
to
virtually
all
of
their
posted

even
if
the
act
were
struck
down
commercial
pornographers
would
continue
to
require
credit
cards
as
they
did
before
the

was
enacted
because
they
do
not
want
to
provide
their
speech

to
the
extent
they
offer

the

would
require
them

the

officially
construing
those

provisions

only
when
the

knows
that

this

itself

the
constitutionality

should
allow

together
throughout
its
papers
the
government
tacitly
acknowledges
the
weakness
of
its
argument
that
section
d
b
can
survive
strict
scrutiny
when
it
states
that
the
constitutional
issues
posed
by
that
provision
are
quot
more
difficult

than

posed

thus
this

if
as
the

has
suggested

principally
aimed

congress
could
have
passed
a

aimed

u

may
not
enact
a

rule

simply
to
spare
itself
the
trouble

of
distinguishing
speech
that
is
the
subject
of
legitimate
regulatory
concern
from
speech
that
is

there
was
no
evidence
that
the
amount
of
indecent
and
patently
offensive
speech
as
a
percentage
of
the
whole
varies
depending
on
its
country
of
origin
for
the
same
reason
the
cda
will
not
directly
and
substantially
further
the
government
s
newly
found
interest
in
expanding
access
to
the

because

theory
will
continue
to
be
deterred
from
permitting
their

to

of
course
even
under
this
interpretation
the

could
still
senselessly

indeed
unconstitutionally
