military
dictator
gen
sani
abacha
though
he
was
placed
in

igiebor
was
hardly
alone
in
fact
a
record
journalists
around
the
world
were
in
jail
at
the
end
of
all
of
them
in
retaliation
for
their
reporting

the
annual

on
the
press
reports
are
widely
recognized
as
the
most
comprehensive
and
authoritative
source
of
information
on
press
freedom
violations
internationally
this
latest
report
analyzes
the
state
of
press
freedom
in
countries
and
examines
more
than
individual
cases
of
journalists
who
were
physically
attacked
imprisoned
threatened
or
censored
in
retaliation
for
their
work
most
of
the
journalists
whose
stories
are
chronicled
in
the
survey
are
not
foreign
correspondents
dispatched
to
distant
wars
but
local
reporters
working
under
corrupt
and
repressive
governments
many
american
journalists
drop
in
on
dangerous
places
like
bosnia
or
rwanda
stay
a
few
weeks
and
go
home
for
most
of
the
people
in
whom
cpj

interested
the
dangerous
places
are
home

turkey

reporters

editors

the
worst
record
of
imprisoning
journalists
than
any
other
country
the
new
turkish
government
should
demonstrate
its
commitment
to
democracy
by
releasing
our
imprisoned
colleagues
and
abolishing
article
of
the
anti

law
and
article
of

are
inherently
