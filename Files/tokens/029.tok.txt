the
most
important
new

in

the
ability

applications
using

geometry
point

the
applications
include
spot

arc
welding
paint
spraying
material
handling
sealant
laser
cutting
water

and
deburring
once
the
geometry
path
has
been
created
and
saved
with
the

the
user
can
issue
a
follow

command
to
automatically
create

simulate
the
robot
programme
in
whatever
robot
language
is
currently
selected
tool
graphics
have
been
designed

many

the

the

many
of
the
new

are
useful
in

during

the
user

the
efficiency
of
the

tool

have
been
improved
while
the

setup
procedures
have
been
altered
to
increase
their
reliability
even
when
used
by
inexperienced

in

the
changes
in
reflect
the
past
few
years
accumulated
experience
from
both
within

and
close
contact
with
industrial
customers
of
simulating

offline
programming
complex
workcells
using

these
