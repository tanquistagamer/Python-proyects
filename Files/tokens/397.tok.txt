access
to
the
health
care
system
the
state
of
illinois
has
many
fine
health
care
providers
and
facilities
yet
illinois
residents
may
face
a
number
of
access
hurdles
before
receiving
treatment
patients
their
families
and
health
care
institutions
all
need
to
be
aware
of
the
legal
framework
that
exists
to
guarantee
access
to
health
care
paying
for
health
care
for
some
the
most
important
health
care
issue
is
paying
for
health
care
several
government
sponsored
health
care
programs
administered
primarily
by
the
illinois
department
of
public
aid
provide
payments
to
health
care
providers
in
most
cases
medical
professionals
have
a
right
to
payment
within
days
medicaid
medicaid
should
not
be
confused
with
medicare
despite
their
similar
names
the
two
programs
are
different
medicare
described
below
is
a
program
funded
and
administered
entirely
by
the
federal
government
to
provide
health
care
to
elderly
persons
and
people
with
disabilities
medicare
coverage
is
uniform
throughout
the
country
medicaid
is
a
cooperative
program
funded
partly
by
the
federal
government
and
partly
by
the
individual
states
and
administered
primarily
by
the
states
that
provide
health
care
to
indigent
persons
each
state
has
wide
latitude
to
decide
how
medicaid
operates
within
the
state
in
illinois
medicaid
is
administered
by
the
illinois
department
of
public
aid
the
federal
government
s
role
in
medicaid
is
quite
limited
it
pays
a
percentage
of
the
cost
of
each
state
s
health
care
program
for
indigent
people
and
ensures
that
every
state
s
program
complies
with
various
federal
requirements
the
amount
of
money
a
state
receives
from
the
federal
government
is
called
the
federal
financial
participation
ffp
each
state
s
ffp
is
determined
by
a
formula
based
on
the
state
s
per
capita
income
and
the
amount
of
medical
services
the
state
chooses
to
provide
to
needy
people
within
the
state
to
receive
medicaid
a
person
must
have
assets
with
a
low
value
and
very
low
income
as
determined
by
a
complex
formula
in
illinois
a
person
generally
can
have
no
more
than
in
assets
and
income
per
month
although
there
is
a
complex
formula
applied
which
considers
the
applicant
s
unique
situation
there
are
several
assets
the
formula
does
not
count
including
homestead
automobile
necessary
for
employment
or
otherwise
to
produce
income
to
receive
health
care
or
essential
for
transporting
a
person
with
disabilities
income
producing
property
household
goods
and
personal
effects
certain
other
assets
are
not
counted
such
as
jointly
held
real
estate
if
the
other
joint
owner
refuses
to
sell
and
property
that
is
tied
up
in
probate
as
long
as
transfers
are
compensated
it
is
legal
to
restructure
one
s
assets
and
income
with
the
intent
of
qualifying
for
medicaid
a
person
whose
income
is
above
medicaid
limits
might
be
able
to
qualify
for
medicaid
under
a
spend
down
provision
the
spend
down
is
equal
to
the
amount
a
person
s
income
is
over
medicaid
limits
medicaid
occasionally
agrees
to
cover
the
amount
that
a
person
s
medical
bills
exceed
a
patient
s
spend
down
many
senior
citizens
find
restructuring
assets
to
qualify
for
medicaid
to
be
an
especially
attractive
option
because
medicaid
coverage
pays
for
a
wider
variety
of
nursing
care
services
and
for
a
longer
period
of
time

costs
of

is
an
optional
program
that
carries
a

people
qualify
for
hospital
insurance
when
they
turn
years
old
or
if
they
are
covered
by
social

or
railroad
retirement

the

not

anyone

medicare
never
was
intended
to
provide
comprehensive
coverage
for
all
medical
needs
of
america
s
elderly
population
but
rather
was
intended
to
supplement
private
resources
many
health
services
are
not
covered
by
medicare
for
example
medicare
does
not
pay
for
custodial
care
intended
to
help
the
patient
with
his
or
her
daily
living
needs
such
as

issues
many
people
look
for
some
form
of
private
insurance
to
supplement
medicare
and
other
government
sponsored
health
coverage
some
people
are
insured
through
their
jobs
and
even
when
they
retire
may
be
able
to
get
continuation
or
conversion
coverage
from
these
group
policies
others
join
health
maintenance
organizations
another
popular
option
in
illinois
is
coverage
under
the
illinois
comprehensive
health
insurance
plan
this
program
was
intended
as
an
alternative
to
traditional
health
insurance
it
benefits
illinois
residents
who
are
refused
health
insurance
by
private
health
insurance
companies
or
who
can
obtain
insurance
but
only
at
an
excessive
rate
the
comprehensive
health
insurance
plan
provides
coverage
for
medically
necessary
treatment
such
as
hospital
services
in
illinois
two
additional
programs
help
older
people
and
people
with
disabilities
pay
for
their
medicare
coverage
in
order
to
be
eligible
for
these
programs
an
individual
must
have
assets
of
no
more
than

must
live
in
illinois
the

program
qmb
assists
those
who
have

insurance
and
whose
income

access
to

hospitals
rarely
refuse
to
treat
a
patient
if
the
patient
has
health

insurance
but
sometimes
hospitals
do
refuse
to
admit
patients
federal
and
state
laws
governing
the
medical
industry
clearly
forbid
health
care
providers
from
discriminating
in
deciding
whom
to
treat
the
internal
revenue
service
requires
hospitals
to
admit
all
paying
members
of
their
communities
in
order
to
enjoy
tax
exempt
status
the
hill
burton
act
which
provides
construction
grants
for
many
hospital
projects
requires
hospitals
receiving
grants
under
its
programs
to
admit
all
paying
patients
medicare
and
medicaid
require
all
participating
hospitals
to
provide
care
to
all
covered
patients
fortunately
most
of
these
laws
guaranteeing
access
to
health
care
facilities
are
invoked
infrequently
most
hospitals
are
eager
to
admit
patients
sometimes
however
because
of
prejudices
or
a
hospital
s
concern
about
being
reimbursed
medicare
or
medicaid
recipients
have
more
difficulty
accessing
hospitals
the
aids
epidemic
has
made
accessibility
an
issue
in
some
recent
cases
in
which
hospital
decision
makers
were
concerned
with
the
potentially
enormous
costs
of
fighting
the
disease
worried
about
spreading
the
disease
or
objected
to
the
lifestyles
they
assumed
aids
sufferers
led
hospitals
and
other
providers
of
health
care
should
be
aware
of
the
laws
in
this
area
and
should
know
that
refusing
a

health
care
based
on
personal
bias
is
illegal
health
care
providers
responsibilities
once
a
patient
and
a
health
care
provider
have
formed
a
relationship
inside
the
health
care
system
the
law
guarantees
the
patient
certain
rights
and
requires
certain
duties
of
the
health
care
provider
in
addition
to
a
general
right
to
good
medical
care
which
includes
being
informed
of
who
is
treating

the

exercise
informed
consent
to
refuse

to
obtain
certain

confidentially
other
laws

penalizes

rights
consent
to

in
general
a
doctor
may
not
diagnose
or
treat
a
patient
without
obtaining
that

s
informed
consent
first
informed
consent
means
the
person
has
given
consent
after
receiving
all
relevant
information
about
the
treatment
including
the
risks
failure
to

may
give

the
head
of

facility
will
consent

if

a

alternatives
a

or
chemical

minors
generally
need
the

of

or
surgical
procedure
exceptions
to
this
rule
are
emergencies
certain
reproductive
matters
and
testing
and
treatment
for
certain
sexually
transmitted
diseases
most
doctors
know
they
should
not
treat
a
patient
without
any
permission
so
disputes
in
this
area
rarely
center
on
whether
a
doctor
had
permission
more
often
disputes
turn
on
whether
the
doctor
disclosed
sufficient
information
for
the
patient
s
consent
to
be
informed
or
whether
the
doctor
went
beyond
the

actions
to
give

in
illinois
a
patient
must
be
given
information
about
the
foreseeable
results
and
risks
of
a
particular
procedure
and
the
reasonable
alternatives
the
physician
does
not
have
to
disclose
every
possible
risk
it
is
up
to
the
doctor
to
decide
what
to
tell
the
patient
based
on
the
patient
s
best
interests
all
of
these
must
be
communicated
in
language
the
patient
is
likely
to
understand
experimental
procedures
or
research
may
not
be
performed
on
a

without

consent
prior

experimental
procedures
or
research
must
be
recorded
in

right
to
refuse
treatment
illinois
law
also
gives
patients
the
right
to
refuse
treatment
or
medication
patients
who
refuse
recommended
treatments
must
be
informed
of
the
likely
medical
and
psychological
results
of
such
refusal
and
documentation
must
be
placed
in

records
the
right
of
parents
to
refuse
medical
treatment
for
their
children
is
more
limited
written
information
illinois
law
provides
that
patients
have
the
right
certain
information
in
writing
every
patient
has
a
right
to
a
written
bill
for
services
if
the
bill
is
not
understandable
the
patient
has
a
right
to
an

must
receive

copy
of
the
medical
patient
rights
act

statement
summarizing
the
rights
described
in

law
if
the

the

must
give

or
representative
hiv
testing
clinics
and
hospitals
in
illinois
test
patients
for
hiv
the
virus
that
causes
aids
because
of
the
discrimination
many
hiv
positive
people
face
there
is
concern
for
confidentiality
and
anonymity
of
the
test
while
all
health
care
providers
are
required
to
respect
a
patient
s
confidentiality
some
clinics
are
committed
to
anonymous
testing
at
these
sites
fictitious
names
or
code
numbers
are
used
to
hide
the
patient
s
identity
anyone
interested
in
providing
hiv
testing
should
understand
the
important
distinction
between
anonymous
testing
and
confidential
testing
a
test
can
be
confidential
yet
still
be
recorded
on
a
patient
s
permanent
record
anyone
with
access
to
that
record
including
doctors
insurance
companies
and
health
departments
can
learn
that
the
person
was
tested
if
the
testing
is
anonymous
no
one
at
the
testing
site
knows
the
person
s
true
identity
so
the
test
never
becomes
part
of
the
person
s
permanent
medical
record
confidentiality
illinois
law
provides
that
health
care
providers
must
keep
confidential
patients
medical
records
and
any
information
patients
provide
them
for
example
illinois
rules
of
evidence
prohibit
the
introduction
in
court
of
confidential
communications
between
a
patient
and
a
health
care
provider
the
public
policy
behind
this
rule
is
the
promotion
of
complete
communication
between
doctors
and
their
patients
under
other
illinois
laws
a
health
care
provider
must
have
the
patient
s
consent
to
release
records
to
a
third
person
this
general
law
does
not
prevent
a
doctor
from
releasing
records
to
another
doctor
in
an
emergency
for
the
purpose
of
treating
the
patient
it
also
does
not
prevent
the
release
of
records
to
the
illinois
department
of
public
health
both
of
these
protections
will
be
set
aside
if
they
conflict
with
other
public
policies
for
example
a
doctor
who
is
told
by
a
patient
that
the
patient
plans
to
kill
a
particular
person
has
a
legal
obligation
to
warn
that
person
also
doctors
have
an
obligation
to
report
to
the
police
anyone
who
comes
for
treatment
of
a
suspicious
wound
such
as
a
stab
or
gunshot
wound
confidentiality
also
may
be
relinquished
by
people
who
are
hiv
positive
the
state
of
illinois
requires
that
a
diagnosis
of
hiv
positive
status
be
reported
to
the
state
department
of
public
health
anatomical
gifts
many
people
want
to
donate
their
bodies
to
science
when
they
die
many
human
organs
can
be
transplanted
into
another
person
giving
the
recipient
a
chance
at
a
longer
or
more
productive
life
a
wide
variety
of
institutions
also
need
bodies
and
organs
for
scientific
medical
and
educational
purposes
unfortunately
many
potential
transplant
recipients
and
many
scientific
and
educational
institutions
are
unable
to
get
sufficient
donations
because
too
few
people
are
willing
to
donate
or
do
not
know
how
to
make
their
wishes
known
to
solve
this
problem
illinois
adopted
the
uniform
anatomical
gift
act
to
govern
the
donation
of
bodies
and
body
parts
for
transplant
medical
and
scientific
purposes
under
this
