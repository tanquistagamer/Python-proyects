factors

not
be
the
same
choice

each
option
has
benefits
and
drawbacks
the

change
over
time

business

and
liabilities

a
person

issues
of
concern
to
businesspersons

business
attorneys
the
following
is
a
brief
summary
of
the
common
forms
of
business
organizations
at
the
end
of
the
chapter
issues
that
may
affect
all
forms
of
business
will
be
outlined
including
registering
an
assumed
name
and
obtaining
tax
identification
numbers
and
licenses
sole
proprietorship
a
sole
proprietorship
is
the
simplest
form
of
business
organization
one
person
owns
manages
and
controls
the
business
a
sole
proprietorship
may
have
employees
but
only
the
owner
is
in
charge
of
the
business
the
owner
receives
the
business
profits
and
losses
this
person
is
also
responsible
for
any
debts
the
business
may
incur
income
expenses
and
losses
are
reported
on
the
business
owner
s
individual
tax
return
a
sole
proprietorship
is
relatively
easy
to
organize
the
business
owner
must
acquire
the
appropriate
licenses
if
any
and
tax
identification
numbers
and
must
register
the
business
name
there
are
no
specific
state
filing
requirements
for
this
business
option
the
benefits
of
the
sole
proprietorship
include
having
complete
control
over
the
business
ease
of
the
initial
set
up
and
having
business
profits
taxed
at
the
individual
taxpayer
rate
which
is
lower
than
the
rate
charged
to
corporations
the
drawbacks
to
sole
proprietorship
include
being
personally
responsible
for
debts
and
liabilities
of
the
business
for
example
if
a
business
owner
has
debts
that
are
not
being
paid
the
creditors
can
reach
the
personal
assets
of
the
business
owner
such
as
a
personal
checking
account
a
business
owner
may
obtain
insurance
to
minimize
this
drawback
other
drawbacks
include
lack
of
continuity
when
the
business
owner
dies
the
business
ceases
to
exist
and
the
fact
that
a
sole
proprietor
is
not
able
to
deduct
benefits
like
health
dental
and
life
insurance
on
his
or
her
income
tax
return
as
business
expenses
partnership
a
partnership
is
a
business
owned
by
two
or
more
parties
in
illinois
it
is
possible
to
form
three
types
of
partnerships
general
limited
and
limited
liability
general
partnership
a
general
partnership
occurs
when
two
or
more
persons
own
manage
and
control
a
business
persons
in
a
general
partnership
share
the
rights
duties
and
responsibilities
partnerships
may
also
have
employees
however
only
the
partners
have
control
of
the
business
activities
a
partnership
has
more
issues
to
address
than
the
sole
proprietorship
besides
obtaining
the
appropriate
licenses
and
tax
numbers
and
registering
the
business
name
partners
must
agree
on
the
treatment
of
business
profits
expenses
losses
and
other
business
concerns
typically
there
is
a
written
agreement
between
the
partners
to
address
these
issues
a
general
partnership
in
illinois
need
not
be
registered
with
the
state
and
there
are
no
formal
requirements
for
its
formation
however
state
law
governs
the
conduct
liabilities
and
dissolution
of
a
partnership
as
well
as
the
relationship
between
and
liabilities
of
the
partners
the
benefits
of
a
general
partnership
include
the
owners
control
of
the
business
however
unlike
the
sole
proprietor
who
has
exclusive
control
partners
share
control
and
responsibilities
partners
have
the
advantage
of
more
than
one
resource
for
finances
ideas
and
sharing
the
work
load
the
formation
of
a
general
partnership
can
be
less
complicated
than
other
business
formats
such
as
limited
partnerships
and
corporations
finally
profits
from
the
partnership
are
included
on
the
partners
individual
tax
returns
and
taxed
at
the
individual
taxpayer
rate
which
is
lower
than
the
rate
charged
to
corporations
the
drawbacks
to
a
general
partnership
include
the
partners
personal
responsibility
for
the
debts
and
liabilities
of
the
partnership
a
partner
can
be
liable
for
debts
incurred
by
other
partners
in
furtherance
of
the
business
as
in
a
sole
proprietorship
a
partnership
may
obtain
insurance
to
minimize
this
drawback
business
partners
are
treated
like
sole
proprietors
with
regard
to
deducting
benefits
provided
to
themselves
benefits
like
health
dental
and
life
insurance
may
generally
not
be
deducted
on
partners
income
tax
returns
as
business
expenses
in
a
general
partnership
the
business
generally
dissolves
upon
the
death
retirement
or
withdrawal
of
a
partner
unless
there
is
an
express
agreement
to
continue
the
business
under
such
circumstances
if
the
business
is
continued
the
former
partner
or
the
former
partner
s
legal
representative
is
entitled
to
the
value
of
the
former
partner
s
interest
or
the
profits
attributable
to
the
use
of
the
former
partner
s
right
in
the
property
by
law
if
a
partnership
interest
is
assigned
to
another
person
that
person
is
only
entitled
to
the
partner
s
profits
from
the
business
that
person
may
not
participate
in
the
management
or
operation
of
the
partnership
unless
all
the
partners
agree
these
legal
requirements
may
be
modified
by
a
partnership
agreement
a
partnership
agreement
may
detail
how
a
partnership
interest
may
be
sold
transferred
or
handled
upon
the
death
of
a
partner
addressing
potential
issues
in
an
agreement
may
be
one
way
to
prevent
disputes
from
occurring
limited
partnership
a
limited
partnership
is
similar
in
many
respects
to
a
general
partnership
however
in
a
limited
partnership
there
are
two
types
of
partners
general
and
limited
illinois
law
requires
that
a
limited
partnership
have
one
or
more
general
partners
and
one
or
more
limited
partners
the
principal
difference
between
a
general
and
limited
partner
is
that
the
limited
partner
can
limit
his
or
her
personal
liability
for
partnership
debts
to
the
amount
he
or
she
invests
in
the
partnership
the
limited
partner
in
exchange
for
the
reduction
in
liability
does
not
control
or
manage
the
business
the
general
partner
controls
and
manages
the
business
and
is
personally
liable
for
partnership
debts
because
limited
partnerships
must
meet
specific
illinois
statutory
requirements
they
can
be
more
complicated
to
establish
a
limited
partnership
must
apply
for
a
certificate
of
limited
partnership
from
the
secretary
of
state
and
this
certification
must
be
renewed
every
two
years
a
limited
partnership
must
maintain
certain
records
and
must
follow
specific
requirements
for
registering
the
business
name
a
limited
partnership
is
not
permitted
to
engage
in
the
businesses
of
insurance
banking
or
operating
a
railroad
the
benefits
of
a
limited
partnership
depend
on
whether
one
is
a
general
or
limited
partner
the
general
partner
enjoys
control
and
management
responsibilities
the
limited
partner
receives
limited
personal
liability
profits
for
both
types
of
partners
are
included
on
the
partners
individual
tax
returns
and
taxed
at
the
individual
taxpayer
rate
which
is
lower
than
the
rate
charged
to
corporations
the
drawbacks
of
a
limited
partnership
also
depend
on
whether
one
is
a
general
or
limited
partner
a
general
partner
is
personally
responsible
for
the
business
debts
while
the
limited
partner
is
only
liable
for
debts
up
to
the
amount
he
or
she
has
invested
in
the
partnership
the
limited
partner
does
not
participate
in
the
management
or
control
of
the
business
business
partners
are
treated
like
sole
proprietors
with
regard
to
deducting
benefits
provided
to
themselves
benefits
like
health
dental
and
life
insurance
may
generally
not
be
deducted
on
partners
income
tax
returns
as
business
expenses
unlike
a
sole
proprietorship
or
general
partnership
when
a
limited
partnership
wishes
to
dissolve
it
must
file
a
certificate
of
cancellation
with
the
illinois
secretary
of
state
in
order
to
cancel
its
certificate
of
limited
partnership
as
mentioned
previously
there
are
laws
that
apply
to
limited
partnerships
specifically
that
make
this
format
more
time
consuming
and
complex
a
limited
partnership
can
continue
after
the
death
or
departure
of
a
partner
the
departing
partner
or
his
or
her
beneficiaries
may
be
entitled
to
the
fair
market
value
of
the
partnership
interest
the
beneficiaries
also
may
have
the
option
of
becoming
limited
partners
a
partner
s
interest
in
a
limited
partnership
may
be
assigned
however
the
party
receiving
the
assignment
is
only
entitled
to
the
profits
that
the
assigning
partner
would
have
received
the
partners
may
agree
that
the
person
receiving
the
assignment
becomes
a
limited
partner
this
legal
requirement
may
be
modified
by
a
partnership
agreement
a
partnership
agreement
may
detail
the
conditions
of
how
a
partnership
interest
may
be
sold
transferred
or
handled
upon
the
departure
or
death
of
a
partner

or
wrongful
acts

liable
for

wrongful
acts
and
