technology
three
different
engines
using
different
fuels
hydrogen
extracted
within
the
engine
from
methanol
using
catalysis
and
the
heat
of
the
exhaust
the
axial
engine
which
automatically
changes
piston
stroke
depending

gasoline
and

advantages
the
developers
claim
that
the
hydrogen
engine
can
meet
the
zero
emissions
requirement
set
for
california
and
other
states
for
by
generating
the
hydrogen
onboard
no
new
distribution
and
storage
system
is
needed
alternatively
the
engine
can
run
on
methanol
or
other
fuels
directly
carbon
monoxide
and
hydrocarbons
are
reduced
by
and
nox
by
according
to
the
developers
the
axial
engine
with
its
novel
arrangement
of
five
or
seven
cylinders
can
reduce
fuel
consumption
by
engine
weight
by
and
emissions
by
compared
to
similar
horsepower
gasoline
engines
at
idle
speeds
the
piston
stroke
is
shortened
resulting
in
