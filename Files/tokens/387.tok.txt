regarding

it
is
very
important
to

law
governing
maritime
issues
is
a
complicated
jumble
of
federal
statutes
united

supreme
court
decisions
and
centuries
old
common
law
a

a
reminder

occurs
where
there
are
defective
or
an
insufficient
number
of
warning
lights
and
signs
additionally
railroad
engineers
and
crews
have

horn
when
approaching
potentially
dangerous
areas
persons
crossing
or
near
railroad
tracks
also
have
a
duty
to
act
reasonably
remember
that
illinois
recognizes
the
doctrine
of
comparative
negligence
if
a
person
is
partially
responsible
for
an
accident
any
damage
award
he
or
she
receives
can
be
reduced
by
the
extent
to
which
he
or
she
was
responsible

accidents
while
commercial
aircraft
remain
the
safest
means
of
long
distance
travel
accidents
do
happen
and
the
litigation
that
follows
an
airline
crash
is
notoriously
complicated
plaintiff
lawyers
in
airline
cases
face
a
variety
of
difficult
issues
for
example
what
law
federal
or
state
should
be
used
where
is
the
best
forum
for
the
trial
should
lawsuits
be
brought
individually
or
as
a
class
action
who
should
be
sued
as
a
defendant
aircraft
manufacturer
aircraft

manufacturer
or
corporate
officers
component

theory
of
