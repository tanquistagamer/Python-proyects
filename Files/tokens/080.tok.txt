the
difference
between
the
airsar
cm
data
and
sir
c
mlc
data
is
chiefly
that
for
airsar
the
elements
of
the
stokes
matrix
are
stored
directly
to
each
compressed
byte
while
for
sir
c
the
cross
products
that
when
combined
appropriately
comprise
the
stokes
matrix
are
stored
in
addition
the
airsar
data
employs
a
general
scale
factor
while
sir
c
does
not
and
finally
the
value
stored
in
the
first
two
bytes
by
airsar
is
the
total
power
divided
by
the
general
scale
factor
while
the
value
stored
in
the
first
two
bytes
by
sir
c
is
four
times
the
total
power
the
stokes
matrix
and
cross
products
the
symmetrized
stokes
matrix
may
be
formed
from
the
cross
products
of
the
scattering
matrix
that
are
stored
by
