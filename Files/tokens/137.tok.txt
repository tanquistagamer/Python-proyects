this
paper
presents
the
climatology
of
the
east
asian
winter
monsoon
and
cold

based
on
the
ncep
ncar
reanalysis
in
addition
to
documenting
the
frequency
intensity
and
preferred
propagation
tracks
of
cold
surges
and
the
evolution
patterns
of
associated
fields
the
temporal
distribution
of
the
siberian
high
and
cold
surges
is
discussed
further
this
study
examines
the
interannual
variation
of
the
winter
monsoon
and
cold
surges
and
its
relationship
with
enso
there
are
on
average
thirteen
cold
surges
in
each
winter
season
october
to
april
of
which
two
are
strong
cases
the
averaged
intensity
of
cold
surges
measured
by
maximum
surface
pressure
is
hpa
the
cold
surges
originate
from
two
primary
source
regions
northwest
of
lake
baikal
and
north
of
lake
balkhash
the
typical
evolution
of
a
cold

occurs
over
the
period
of

trajectory
and
correlation
analyses
indicate
that
during
this
time
high
pressure
centers
propagate
southeastward
around
the
edge
of
the
tibetan
plateau
from
the
mentioned
source
regions
some
of
these
high
pressure
centers
then
move
eastward
and
diminish
over
the
ocean
while
others
proceed
southward
the
signature
of
the
associated
temperature

and
pressure
fields
propagate
farther
southward
and
eastward
the
affected
area
encompasses
the
bulk
of
the
maritime
continent
although
the
intensity
of
the
siberian
high
is
found
to
peak
during
december
and
january
the
frequency
of
cold
surges
has
a
maximum
in
november
and
in
march
this
result
suggests
that
november
through
march
should
be
considered
as
the
east

winter
monsoon
season
two
stratifications
of
cold
surges
are
used
to
examine
the
relationship
between
enso
and
the
interannual

of
the
winter
monsoon
the

described
as
the

indicates
that
the

frequency
reaches
a

the
second
one
defined
as
the

introduction
the
east
asian
winter
monsoon
which
is
associated
with
a
strong
siberian
high
and
active
cold
surges
is
one
of
the
most
energetic
monsoon
circulation
systems
the
dramatic
shift
of
the
northeasterlies
and
the
outbreak
of
cold
surges
dominate
the
winter
weather
and
climate
in
the
east
asian
region
the
winter
monsoon
and
cold
surges
exert
a
strong
impact
on
the
extratropical
and
tropical
planetary
scale
circulations
chang
and
lau
and
influence
the
ssts
in
the
tropical
western

chang
et
al
their
general
characteristics
and
the
possible
linkage
between
cold
surges
and
tropical
atmospheric
and
oceanic
phenomena
have
been
examined
in
many
studies
for
example
chang
and
lau
showed
that
the
outbreak
of
winter
monsoon
surges
forced
short
term
changes
in
the
hadley

walker
circulation
the
east

jetstream
and
large

the
equatorial
western

boyle
a
b
found
that
the
frequency
and
intensity
of
the
monsoon
surges
for
a
given
month
were
related
to
the
intensity
of
the
east
asian
jetstream
and
the
extratropical
large
scale
circulation
patterns
lau
and
chang
suggested
that
the
interannual
variations
of
the
winter
monsoon
and
cold
surges
may
be
related
to
enso
and
tropical
intraseasonal
oscillations
ding
and
krishnamurti
noted
an
eastward
shift
of
the
tropical
planetary
scale
divergent
circulation
in
association
with
the
cold

which
was
very
similar
to
the
shift
of
the

between

however
little
attention
has
been

the
purpose
of
this

is
to
present
the
climatology
of
cold

the
siberian

based
on
the

we
emphasize
the

their

patterns
of
particular
interest
is
the
interannual

of
winter
monsoon
and
cold

given
that
the
winter
monsoon
activity
was
weaker
during
the

one
of
our
goals
is
to
determine
if

and
is
summarized
here
to
serve
as
a
background
for
this
paper
the
dominant
surface
feature
of
the
winter
monsoon
is
the
siberian

shown
in

this

system

central

covers
the
entire
east
asian
continent
and
yields
northeasterly
flow
over
a
large
part
of
asia
at
hpa
the
flow
pattern
is
dominated
by
the
coastal
trough
the
intensity
of
this
trough
is
quasi
geostrophically
linked
to
the
surface
siberian
high
at
hpa
the
most
prominent
feature
is
the
east
asian
jet
near
japan
this
jet
the
strongest
on
the
globe
is
associated
with
intense
baroclinicity
large
vertical
wind
shear
and
strong
cold
advection
it
is
maintained
by
the
coriolis
torque
acceleration
exerted
on
the
ageostrophic
wind
near
the
jet
entrance
region
its
strength
is
inherently
related
to
the
intensity
of
the
surface
siberian
high
and
the
hpa
trough
these
features
characterize
the
three
dimensional
large
scale
monsoon
circulation
fig

the
winter

from
this
climatological
surface
wind
represents
contributions
from
both
the
quasi

siberian
high
and
the
cold
surges
north
of
deg
n
the
wind
blows
along
the
north
and
east
periphery
of
the
siberian
high
this
anticyclonic
flow
pattern
is
a
reflection
of
the
quasi
stationary
pressure
system
south
of
deg
n
where
the
siberian
high
pressure
exerts
less
influence
the
wind
maximum
near
the
south
china
sea
can
be
largely
attributed
to
the
cumulative
effects
of
the
cold
surges
one
of
the
main
features
of
this
field
is
that
the
westerly
flow
near
japan
bifurcates
the
eastward
branch
merges
with
the
aleutian
low
the
southern
branch
joins
the
tradewind
belt
cold
air
intensity
and
thickness
usually
reduce
significantly
as
the
airmass
moves
southward

the
winter
monsoon
is
a
shallow

variance

the
standard

of

in

indicates
that
the
siberian
high
pressure
is
a
rather
stationary
feature
of
the
winter
monsoon
the
largest
variations
occur
to
the
northwest
of
the
siberian

and
to
the

where
the

near

although

is

at

as

also
occurs
over
eastern

this
is
noticed
as
a
pronounced

over
this
region
a
similar
but
less
well
defined
southward

is
also
seen
in
the

the

here
cold
surges
and
siberian
high
the
cold
surges
are
the
most
important
transient
disturbances
embedded
within
the
mean
monsoon
circulation
the
occurrence
of
a
cold
surge
is
characterized
by
a
southward
movement
of
a
surface
anticyclone
and
an
associated
abrupt
hours
surface
air
temperature
drop
in
the
affected
regions
the
typical
scenario
of
a
cold
air
outbreak
is
the
siberian
high
and
the
coastal
trough
reach
a
certain
intensity
further
west
over
the
continent
an
upper
level
short
wave
undergoes
strong
development
as
it
moves
eastward
eventually
the
short
wave
develops
into
a
major
trough
and
replaces
the
old
quasi
stationary
coastal
trough
during
this
process
a
surface
anticyclone
moves
southward
and
a
cold
surge
occurs
staff
members
of
academia
sinica
it
should
be
pointed
out
that
the
build
up
and
maintenance
of
the
siberian
high
pressure
is
a
necessary
condition
for
the
occurrence
of
cold
surges
radiative
cooling
persistent
cold
air
advection
usually
blocking
over
urals
throughout
the
troposphere
and
large
scale
descending
motion
all
contribute
to
the
maintenance
of
the
cold
siberian
high
ding

krishnamurti
however
cold
surges
should
not
be
regarded
as
the
simple
southward
expansion
or
temporal
variability
of
the
siberian
highs
rather
it
is
of
a
separate
dynamical

the
siberian

the

are
the
two
most

a

of
the
often

definitions
is
given
in

some
of
the
cold

are
purposely
defined
for
the
convenience
of

forecasting
definitions
vary
depending
on
regions
of

for

cold

defined
over

sea
may
have
nothing
to
do
with
cold
surges
defined
near
korea
the
essence
of
the
cold
surges
as
mentioned
above
is
the
rapid
south
southeastward
movement
of
a
surface
anticyclone
which
brings
significant
surface

temperature
drop
in
the

regions
in

contradicts
with
the
well

close
relationship
between
the

of
the
siberian
high
and
occurrence
of
cold
surges
ding
both
dynamical
and
thermodynamical
reasons
can
be
attributed
to
this
first
the
east
asian
large
scale
flow
is
usually
in
a
low
index
mode
during
the
regime
transition
period
of
november
and
march
zhu
et
al
in
december
and
january
however
the
usual
high
index
large
scale
flow
is
characterized
by
a
strong
siberian
high
and
an
intense
jetstream
this
pattern
is
unfavorable
for
the
occurrence
of
cold
surges
despite
the
abundance
of
cold
air
during
this
time
this
is
because
that
the
short
waves
tend
to
move
rapidly
through
such
a
pattern
without
causing
any
disturbances
boyle
a
the
low
index
flow
background
on
the
other
hand
typically
has
a
blocking
over
the
asian
continent
and
deep
troughing
along
the
coast
this
flow
pattern
yields
a
northwesterly
flow
over
lake
baikal
which
is
highly
unstable
and
more
ready
to
release
potential
energy
when
triggered
by
a
short
wave
boyle
a
secondly
an
important
criterion
of
a
cold
surge
is
the
hour
surface
air
temperature
drop
during
december
and
january
the
jetstream
is
further
south
and
the
surface
air
temperature
is
relatively
lower
as
such
it
takes
a
very
strong
anticyclone
to
induce
a
substantial
temperature
change
in
a
cold
background
while
the
surface
air
temperature
is
relatively
warmer
during
november
and
march
cold
air
and
anticyclones
with
modest
intensity
can
significantly
reduce
the
surface
air
temperature
from
the
view
of
weather
forecasters
it
is
the
cold
surges
that
occur
during
november
and
march
that
yield
a
more
abrupt
temperature
drop
have
the
most
significant
damaging
effect
on
local
agriculture
and
economy
recently
a
very
similar
monthly
distribution
of
cold
surges
has
been
found
by
ding
and
collaborators
based
on
cold
surges
from
winters
ding
personal
communication
they
suggest
that
the
warm
and
moist
troughs
that
moving
out
of
the
bay
of
bengal
result
in
the
relatively
lower
frequency
cold
surges
during
december
and
january
as
mentioned
before
one
of
the
necessary
conditions
of
cold
surge
outbreak
is
that
the
siberian
high
reaches
a
certain
intensity
but
this
is
by
no
means
guarantee
that
the
cold
surge
frequency
should
monotonically
increase
as
the
siberian
high
intensifies
the
statistics
based
on
the
year
data
shown
here
and
ding
s
recent
results
do
not
support
quot
the
higher
the
siberian
high
pressure
the
greater
the
possibility
of
cold
surge
occurrence
quot
ding
a
statement
that
has
been
mistakenly
known
in
the
forecasting
community
the
temporal
distribution
of
strong
cold
surges
is
examined
of
all
the
strong
cases
identified
of
them
occurred
in
december
january
and
february
and
five
in
november
only
one
in
march
and
none
during
october
or
april
the
strong
cold
surges
tend
to
occur
during
very
cold
months
this
suggests
that
large
surface
pressure
gradient
associated
with
a
very
strong
surface
anticyclone
and
abundant
sources
of
cold
air
is
an
important
driving
force
to
push
the
cold
air
far
into
the
tropics
this
result
also
suggests
that
the
intensity
of
the
siberian
high
may
be
related
to
the
occurrence
of
strong
cold
surges
that
affect
the
tropical
regions
because
the
cold
surge
frequency
is
high
in
november
and
march
and
the
prevailing
northeasterly
wind
dominates
a
large
area
of

the

of
this

we
investigated
the

the

were
found
to
be

summary
and
discussion
the
study
of
the
east
asian
winter
monsoon
and
cold
surges
from
the
ncep
ncar
reanalyses
has
revealed
and
extended
several
noteworthy
climatological
features
of
the
winter
monsoon
according
to
the
conventional
cold
surge
criteria
about
cold
surges
occur
every
winter
season
of
which
two
are
strong
cases
that
influence
the
tropical
region
the
average
lifetime
of
the
cold
surges
is
about
days
and
the
average
intensity
of
highs
is
hpa
the
strong
cases
usually
last
for
about
days
with
average
intensity
of
hpa
the
cold
surges
tend
to
originate
from
two
source
regions
one
is
near
the
northwest
of
lake
baikal
and
the
other
is
to
the
north
of
lake
balkhash
the
high
pressure
centers
propagate
southeastward
and
end
in
the
east
and
southeast
of
china
and
surrounding
oceans
consistent
with
trajectories
of
pressure
centers
correlation
patterns
indicate
that
the
signature
of
associated
slp
surface
wind
and
surface
air
temperature
stretches
further
south
and
east
the
southward
extent
includes
the
bulk
of
the
maritime
continent
the
eastward
extent
reaches
deg
e
although
the
intensity
of
the
siberian
high
varies
according
to
the
season
and
reaches
its
peak
in
january
the
cold
surges
are
most
active
during
november
and
march
this
result
suggests
that
november
through
march
should
be
considered
as
the
east
asian
winter
monsoon
season
it
also
indicates
that
the
occurrence
of
cold
surges
does
not
monotonically
increase
with
the
strengthening
of
the
siberian
high
an
empirical
rule
that
has
been
widely
believed
in
the
forecasting
community
examination
of
monthly
distribution
of
strong
cold
surges
indicates
however
that
the
majority
of
strong
cold
surges
occurs
during
djf
this
result
suggests
that
large
pressure
gradient
associated
with
strong
siberian
high
is
an
important
driving
force
to
push
the
cold
air
far
into
the
tropics
the
two
stratifications
of
cold
surges
are
revealing
when
considering
the
relationship
between
enso
and
the
interannual
variation
of
the
cold
air
activity
the
first
stratification
as
described
in
the
cold
surge
identification
criteria
yields
result
that
is
consistent
with
the
in
situ
observation
from
bmc
the
interannual
variation
of
cold
surge
frequency
shows
that
minimum
surge
frequency
occurs
one
year
after
an
el
nino
event
the
second
stratification
based
on
the
maximum
meridional
wind
event
in
the
south
china
sea
indicates
that
the
interannual
variation
of
the
south
china
sea
cold
surge
is
in
good
agreement
with
the
soi
high
cold
surge
frequency
is
found
during
la
nina
and
high
soi
events
low
frequency
is
associated
with
el
nino
and
low
soi
events
the
variation
of
the
mean
meridional
wind
near
the
south
china
sea
and
tge
narutune
hinges
on
the
south
china
sea
cold
surges
as
in
the
case
of
the
cold
surges
the
interannual
variation
of
the
wind
is
also
well
correlated
with
the
soi
strong
wind
years
are
associated
with
la
nina
and
high
soi
events
weak
wind
years
are
found
during
el
nino
and
low
soi
events
this
pattern
of
variation
is
restricted
north
of
the
equator
within
deg
n
deg
n
deg
e
deg
e
and
confined
to
the
near
surface
layer
the
interannual
variation
of
the
siberian
high
measured
by
means
of
both
pressure
and
wind
is
in
general
agreement
with
the
soi
both
the
strength
of
the
hpa
jetstream
and
the
hpa
trough
are
found
to
be
weaker
than
normal
during
el
nino
events
although
their
interannual
variation
patterns
do
not
agree
with
the
soi
as
closely
as
that
of
the
siberian
high
given
the
close
relationship
between
the
soi
and
the
interannual
variation
of
the
monsoon
meridional
wind
and
cold
surges
it
is
natural
to
wonder
why
some
of
the
monsoon
related
disturbances
either
originated
from
or
located
in
the
extratropics
exhibit
variation
patterns
similar
to
the
soi
and
what
are
the
physical
mechanisms
between
the
enso
winter
monsoon
interaction
during
a
typical
el
nino
year
the
convective
activity
in
the
maritime
continent
is
usually
reduced
if
the
cumulus
convection
in
this
region
is
one
of
the
most
important
monsoon
energy
sources
as
suggested
by
ramage
the
suppression
of
the
maritime
convection
should
be
responsible
at
least
partly
for
the
weaker
than
normal
extratropical
monsoon
circulation
during
el
nino
events
with
the
available
observed
outgoing
longwave
radiation
olr
data
from
the
national
oceanic
and
atmospheric
administration
we
have
computed
the
olr
anomaly
in
the
maritime
continent
deg

from
the
overall

here
is
not
as

the

as
that
of
the
south

sea
cold

or
the
siberian

however
negative
anomaly
is
found
during
the
la
nina
season
likewise
positive
olr
anomalies
are
found
during
the
and
el
nino
seasons
the
correlation
coefficient
between
the
olr
anomaly
and
the
soi
is
r
on
the
other
hand
evidence
indicated
that
the
winter
monsoon
and
cold
air
activity
can
greatly
affect
the
tropical
convective
activity
and
sst
slingo
personal
communication
found
that
indonesian
convection
is
enhanced
when
cold
surges
penetrated
far
into
the
tropics
chang
et
al
have
shown
that
cold
surges
are
capable
of
influencing
the
tropical
sst
but
whether
the
cold
surges
can
significantly
affect
the
tropical
region
as
has
been
discussed
depends
on
the
intensity
and
path
of
the
cold
surges
it
may
also
relate
to
the
background
large
scale
circulation
theoretical
studies
have
suggested
branstator
lau
and
lim
that
the
interaction
between
the
tropical
convection
and
midlatitude
circulation
depends
critically
on
the
relative
position
of
the
convection
and
extratropical
quasi
stationary
waves
it
has
also
been
suggested
that
the
interaction
between
cold
surges
and
convective
activities
near
the
maritime
continent
will
in
turn
modify
the
extratropical
and
tropical
synoptic
and
planetary
scale
circulations
chang
and
lau
apparently
further
studies
are
much
needed
to
delineate
the
mechanism
of
the
interaction
between
the
winter
monsoon
and
convection
near
the
maritime
continent
in
summary
in
addition
to
extend
and
substantiate
the
climatological
aspects
of
the
east
asian
winter
monsoon
and
cold
surges
the
current
study
has
clearly
indicated
that
the
interannual
variation
of
the
south
china
sea
cold
surges
is
in
good
agreement
with
the
soi
the
south
china
sea
cold
surges
share
the
same
origin
with
the
conventionally
defined
cold

they
also
dominate
the
variation
of
the
area

large

during

however
physical
mechanisms
responsible
for
the
interaction
between

and
the

are
still
not
well
understood
especially
problems
on
