buildings

buildings
fall

sick
buildings
essentially
sick
buildings
are
modern
central
air
conditioned
buildings
that
were
designed
and
built
to
save
energy
and
costs
but
with
little
consideration
for
the
respiratory

the
inhabitants
buildings
become
sick
when
the
air
becomes
stale
because
of
excessive

bacteria

the

protection
agency

consistently
ranks
poor

iaq
as
a
major
health
concern
in
their
studies
hidden
from

sealed
dusts
such
as
dirty
heating
ventilation
and
air

systems
are
the
major
causes
of
poor

dirty

syndrome
sbs
a
disease
not

is
a
pervasive
ailment
caused
by
poor
iaq
in
air

sbs
has
been
accorded
high
priority
by
the

health

who
in

of
the
large
numbers
of

potentially
at
risk
sbs
is
characterised
by

irritation
mental

headaches
and
body
aches
surveys
have
suggested
that
this
syndrome
is
a
major
cause
of
absenteeism
and
reduced
working
efficiency
among
office
workers
resulting
in

similarly
an
iaq
survey
conducted
in
six
air
conditioned
buildings
in
singapore
between
november
and
july
revealed
higher
incidences
of
mental
and
physical
stress
among

a
recent
study
of
the
air
quality
of
commercial
offices
conducted
by
nus
found
that
half
the
number
of
offices
had
unacceptable
formaldehyde
levels
formaldehyde
is
a
cancer
causing
agent
found
in

glue

studied
also
had
unhealthy
carbon

levels
maintaining
air
quality
in
a
sealed
environment
is
an
important
but
often
overlooked
issue
this
is
compounded
by
the
fact
that
most
air
ducts
are
difficult
and
expensive
to
clean
but
now
the
impossible
is
made
easy
