substantive
laws

encourages

is
a
contract

will
result
when

relationship
is

sections

child
custody
child
custody
is
determined
by
a
court
based
upon
the
best

the
children
some
of
the
factors
which
the
courts
consider
in
determining
what
is
in
the
best
interests
of
the
children
are
the
sincerity
of
each
parent
s
desire
to
have
custody
the
wishes
of
the
children
the
interaction
and

of
the
children
with

to
encourage
a
close
and
continuing
relationship
between
the
other
parent
and
the
children
having
custody
of
a
minor
child
can
mean
sole
legal
custody
which
is
the
right
to
make
major
decisions
affecting
the
child
s
life
such
as
medical
care
education
and
religion
and
normally
also
includes
physical
custody
which
is
the
actual
possession
and
control
of
the
child
subject
to
reasonable
visitation
by
the
non
custodial
parent
if
the
parents
have
joint
legal
custody
the
children
reside
mostly
with
one
parent
known
as
the
residential
parent
who
is
responsible
for
the
routine
decisions
affecting
the
children
but
both
parents
share
the
responsibility
for
and
have
a
say
in
making
the
major
decisions
regarding
the
children
if
they
have
joint
physical
custody
both
parents
are
involved
in
even
the
day
to
day
decisions
affecting
their
children
and
the
children
spend
time
with
both
parents
although
not
necessarily
an
equal
amount
of
time
with
each
in
matters
where
the
parties
have
joint

the
time
each
parent
spends
with
their
children
is
known
as
parenting
time
also
in
order
for
a
court
to
award
joint
custody
it
must
determine
that
the

have
the
ability
to
cooperate
effectively
and
consistently
with
each
other
in
matters
that
directly
affect
the
joint
parenting
of
the
children
the
court
must
also
order
the
parents
to
produce
a
joint

agreement

among
other
things
will
normally
provide
for
mediation

visitation
and
parenting

the
non
custodial
parent
is
granted
visitation
rights
unless
the
court
feels
that
such
visits
would
be
detrimental
to
the
children
parents
may
make
child
visitation
agreements
themselves
but
if
a
friendly
agreement
cannot
be
reached
the
court
sets
a
schedule
for
visitation
or
it
orders
that
the
non
custodial
parent
be
allowed
reasonable
visitation
since
the
term
reasonable
is
very
subjective
the
better
practice
is
to
have
a
detailed
visitation
provision
so
that
the
parties
and
the
children
have
more
certainty
as
to
when
the
children
will
be
with
each
parent
certain
other
people

to
note
that

must
also
be
equitably

between
the

invalid
marriages
a
declaration
of
invalidity
of
marriage
formerly
called
an
annulment
is
a
judgment
issued
by
a
court
finding
that
a
couple
s
marriage
is
invalid
and
thus
never
legally
existed
a
distinction
must
be
made
between
void
and
voidable
marriages
void
marriages
are
those
which
never
legally
existed
for
any
purpose
such
as
bigamous
marriages
and
marriages
between
certain
family
members
too
closely
related
by
blood
voidable
marriages
are
those
where
one
of
the
parties
may
bring
an
action
to
have
the
marriage
declared
invalid
because
of
an
impediment
which
existed
at
the
time
of
the
marriage
voidable
marriages
may
result
in
cases
of
fraud
or
when
proper
consent
for
the
marriage
was
not
obtained
for
example
if
one
party
engaged
in
fraud
regarding
his
or
her
willingness
to
cohabit
or
to
consummate
the
marriage
or
was
physically
incapable
of
consummating
the
marriage
the
marriage
may
be
declared
invalid
if
a
party
has
engaged
in
fraud
regarding
paternity
or
pregnancy
or
was
under
age
and
did
not
have
parental
consent
or
judicial
approval
at
the
time
of
the
marriage
the
court
may
declare
the
marriage
invalid
it
is
important
to
note
that
there
are
time
limits
imposed
by
law
wherein
a
party
to
a
voidable
marriage
must
seek
to
have
the
marriage
declared
invalid
or
they
will
be
found
to
have
ratified
the
marriage
and
have
thus
waived
their
right
to
invalidate
the
marriage
it
is
also
important
to
note
that
a
legal
annulment
is
different
from
an
annulment
granted
by
a
church
a
religious
annulment
is
spiritual
rather
than
legal
in
nature
and
does
not
affect
the
legal
status
of
the
marriage
likewise
a
legal
invalidation
may
not
satisfy
the
requirements
for
a
religious
annulment
also
children
born
during
a
marriage
that
later
is
declared
invalid
are
legitimate
finally
if
a
person
has
entered
into
an
invalid
marriage
with
the
good
faith
belief
that
they
entered
into
a
valid
marriage
they
may
be
entitled
to
maintenance
from
the
other
party
legal
separation
a
legal
separation
involves
many
of
the
same
procedures
as
dissolution
a
court
may
make
decisions
regarding
custody
visitation
child
support
spousal
maintenance
and
attorney
fees
however
the
court
does
not
decide
the
property
rights
of
the
parties
after
a
judgment
of
legal
separation
the
couple
remains
legally
married
and
unless
and
until
a
judgment
of
dissolution
is
entered
remarriage
is
forbidden
a
legal
separation
is
granted
on
the
basis
of
a
party
living
separate
and
apart
from
their
spouse
without
fault
sometimes
a
legal
separation
is
sought
by
those
whose
religious
beliefs
prohibit
divorce
but
who
still
desire
child
support
and
spousal
maintenance
it
should
be
noted
that
any
property
acquired
by
a
spouse
after
the
entry
of
a
judgment
of
legal
separation
is
excluded
from
marital
property
should
the
parties
subsequently
obtain
a
dissolution
paternity
paternity
is
the
condition
of
being
the
father
of
a
child
while
the
identity
of
a
child
s
mother
usually
is
obvious
from
birth
the
identity
of
the
father
may
be
unclear
decisions
regarding
child
custody
visitation
and
child
support
frequently
turn
on
whether
a
court
has
established
a
man
s
paternity
of
a
child
illinois
law
presumes
a
man
is
the
father
of
a

if
any
of
the
following
elements
apply

married
to
each
other

the
time

abuse
abuse
is
not
easily
defined
the
legal
definition
of
abuse
is
evolving
and
changing
in
response
to
society
s
changing
understanding
of
the
problem
more
members
of
society
are
becoming
responsible
for
reporting
and
preventing
abuse
for
example
under
illinois
law
health
care
workers
are
obligated
to
provide
suspected
victims
of
domestic
abuse
with
immediate
and
detailed
information
about
the
services
available
to
them
other
professionals
must
report
abuse
they
know
about
or
suspect
abuse
of
family
members
is
against
the
law
but
different
rules
and
standards
apply
to
different
categories
of
abuse

also
called
domestic

is
defined
by
the

act
of
as
physical
abuse
harassment
interference
with
personal
liberty
willful
deprivation
or
intimidation
of
a
family
or
household
member
when
people
talk
about
domestic

they
usually
mean
the
abuse
of
a
woman
by
her
present
or
former
husband
or
boyfriend
child
abuse
and
elder
abuse
often
are
referred
to
separately
domestic

includes
actual
or

and

to
the
extent
that
immediate
physical
harm
is
feared
the

also
includes
emotional
abuse
such
as
harassment
intimidation
and
threats
there
are
several
options
available
to
a
victim
of
domestic
abuse
a
victim
may
file
criminal
charges
file
a
civil
suit
seeking
damages
or
seek
an
order
of
protection
against
the
abuser
usually
the
first
step
is
to
seek
an
order
of
protection
from
a
family
or
county
court
orders
of
protection
an
order
of
protection
is
a
court
order
prohibiting
the

the
respondent
from
continuing
the
abuse
against
the
person
bringing
the
action
the
petitioner
or
against
any
minor
children
in
the
household
the
order
forbids
the
offender
from
physically
harming
or
causing
fear
of
harm
the
order
is
enforceable
throughout
the
state
of
illinois
requirements
orders
of
protection
can
be
obtained
at
the
circuit
courthouse
in
the
county
where
the
victim
lives
to
protect
the
victim
and
substantiate
his
or
her
claim
against
an
abuser
it
is
important
that
application
be
made
as
soon
as
possible
after
the
abuse
occurs
the
petition
for
an
order
of
protection
usually
must
be
made
by
the
victim
however
if
the
victim
is
unable
to
file
the
petition
due
to
age
disability
or
health
someone
may
file
the
petition
on
the
victim
s
behalf
for
a
court
order
to
be
granted
a
petition
must
be
supported
with

of
the
abuse
thus
the
abused
person
must
fill
out
an
affidavit
describing
the
events
or
incidents
surrounding
the
abuse
the
effects
of
the
abuse
on
the
petitioner
and
the
need
for
protection
when
completing
the
paperwork
it
is
helpful
if
the
abused
person
provides
a
picture
of
the
abuser
if
a
picture
is
unavailable
a
description
of
the
offender
is
needed
along
with
the
offender
s
work
and
home
addresses
a
prepared
statement
of
all
incidents
of
abuse
past
and
present
and
including
dates
and
notes
can
help
document
the
need
for
protection
if
necessary
the
abused
person
may
request
an
emergency
order
of
protection
these
orders
also
are
called
temporary
or
ex
parte
orders
of
protection
an
emergency
order
might
be
necessary
when
an
abused
person
is
in
danger
and
the
protection
is
needed
immediately
this
kind
of
order
of
protection
is
valid
only
for
up
to
days
but
may
be
extended
by
the
court
for
good
cause
shown
hearing
a

at
which
a
judge
will
consider
whether
to
issue
a
long
term
up
to
two
years
plenary

is
set
within

cause
shown
further
upon
two
days
notice
to
the
petitioner
a
respondent
subject
to
an
emergency
order
of
protection
may
appear
and
petition
the
court
for
a
rehearing
of
the
original
ex
parte
order
of
protection
the
hearing
is
held
so
that
the
abused
person
and
the
person
accused
of
abuse
can
tell
the
judge
about
the
events
surrounding
the
alleged
abuse
in
order
to
notify
the
person
accused
of
the
abuse
of
the
hearing
the
sheriff
of
the
county
in
which
the
accused
lives
serves
the
papers
on
the
accused
regardless
of
whether
the
accused
person
attends
the
court
hearing
the
abused
person
or
a
representative
if
he
or
she
is
unable
to
attend
due
to
age
or
disability
must
be
present
the
hearing
is
the
opportunity
to
present
evidence
of

and
for
the
person
accused
of
the
abuse
to
respond
at
the
hearing
the
person
alleging
abuse
should
present
medical
records
police
reports
and
all
other
factual
data
which
may
be
used
as
evidence
of
the
abuse
at
this
point
the
judge
usually
rules
on
the
matter
by
granting
the
petition
or
dismissing
the
matter
in
order
to
grant
the
petition
the
judge
must
believe
that
the
petitioner
needs
protection
for
his
or
her
safety
if
the
judge
dismisses
the
matter
he
or
she
does
not
believe
that
the
request
for
protection
is
supported
by
the
evidence
usually
an
order
of
protection
prohibits
the
offender
from
contact
with
the
victim
including
visits
to
the
victim
s
school
or
workplace
when
the
victim
is
present
in
some
cases
the
court
may
order
a
trial
for
cases
in
which
the
abuse
is
denied
a
judge
also
may
include
other
orders
in
the
order
for
protection
such
as
temporarily
changing
child
custody
or
visitation
arrangements
of
children
granting
the
petitioner

should
be
contacted
through
the

must
respond
immediately
and
they
have
a
duty
to
do
everything
possible
to
prevent
further
abuse
once
an
order
of
protection
is
enforced
by
the
police
usually
by
removing
the
abuser
from
the
premises
a
complete
police
report
should
be
filed
documenting
the
incident
police
officers
may
arrest
the
abuser
violating
an
order
is
a
criminal
offense
even
if
the

does
not
make
an

he
or
she
still
must

is
similar
to
that
described
above
a
modification
of
the
order
of

may
be
made
if
the

has
violated
the

wishes
to
add
another
provision
to
the

period
is
needed
