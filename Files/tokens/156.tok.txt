abolition
a
global
network
to
eliminate
nuclear
weapons
the
abolition
network
is
a
network
of
over
organisations
and
growing
on
every
continent
working
for
the
abolition
of
nuclear
weapons
it
grew
from
many
seeds
the
world
court
project
the
international
coalition
for
non
proliferation
the
global
alliance
against
nuclear
arms
the
abolition
caucus
etc
all
of
these
movements
are
like
streams
that
l
ed
into
the
river
that
is
the
abolition
network
it
is
not
a
membership
body
but
is
open
to
all
organisations
endorsing
the
abolition
statement
drafted
at
the
npt
conference
in
new
york
in
its
over
arching
premise
is
the
vision
of
entering
the
st
century
with
a
plan
in
place
f
or
the
elimination
of
nuclear
weapons
what
is
the
network
organisations
have
organised
themselves
into
what
was
termed
a
tight
rather
than
the
usual
loose
network
which
aims
to
provide
group
s
concerned
with
nuclear
issues
a
forum
for
the
exchange
of
information
and
the
development
of
joint
initiatives
the
tightness
of
the
network
like
the
tautness
of
a
web
is
defined
by
how
close
the
members
of
the
network
work
together
and
how
good
the
lines
of
communication
are
the
network
plans
to
have
an
office
in
california
usa
staffed
by
a
facilitator
the
global
network
office
will
be
overseen
by
a
management
group
the
substantive
work
of
the
network
is
done
by
international
working
groups
on
issues
relating
to
the
abolition
of
nuclear
weapons
how
did
it
come
about
in
at
the
conference
to
review
and
extend
the
non
proliferation
treaty
in
new
york
a
group
of
to
activists
representing
ngos
from
all
around
the
world
met
each
day
to
coordinate
their
work
and
called
themselves
the
abolition
caucus
this
group
drafted
a
consensus
document
which
was
known
as
the
abolition
statement
in
less
than
two
weeks
the
first
organisations
had
signed
the
statement
and
this
number
is
still
growing
added
to
this
the
international
coalition
for
non
proliferation
organised
a
meeting
during
the
npt
conference
on
a
draft
nuclear
weapons
convention
called
beyond
the
npt
the
demand
for
a
convention
became
the
prime
focus
of
the
lobbying
work
of
the
abolition
caucus
and
also
of
the
abolition
statement
they
called
on
the
delegates
to
initiate
immediately
and
conclude
by
the
year
negotiations
on
a
nuclear
weapons
abolition
convention
that
requires
the
phased
elimination
of
all
nuclear
weapons
within
a
timebound
framework
with
provisions
for
effective
verification
and
enforcement
the
abolition
caucus
requested
the
npt
parties
to
adopt
this
goal
in
the
final
report
of
the
conference
the
opposition
to
the
indefinite
unconditional
extension
of
the
npt
was
clearly
expressed
in
the
original
statement
which
has
since
been
updated
to
remove
references
to
the
conference
and
other
dates
development
of
the
network
a
core
group
went
on
to
organise
a
further
meeting
in
the
hague
to
coincide
with
the
oral
hearings
at
the
international
court
of
justice
in
november
of
the
advisory
opinion
on
the
use
and
threat
of
use
of
nuclear
weapons
world
court
project
the
participants
at
this
meeting
agreed
by
consensus
to
found
a
network
and
defined
its
structure
the
title
abolition
a
global
network
to
eliminate
nuclear
weapons
was
chosen
the
idea
of
a
tight
network
consisting
of
regions
working
groups
and
a
distribution
communications
centre
later
titled
the
global
network
office
was
born
most
importantly
it
was
decided
that
there
should
be
no
central
committee
to
take
decisions
on
behalf
of
the
network
and
that
initially
no
common
strategy
would
be
decided
except
to
take
action
under
the
only
agreed
common
position
the
abolition
statement
which
everybody
had
signed
the
group
that
had
organised
the
meeting
in
the
hague
was
given
the
task
of
setting
up
the
office
and
finding
the
funding
for
a
staff
person
for
it
a
second
meeting
in
edinburgh
in
march
gave
this
group
the
title
interim
management
group
whose
function
is
solely
to
oversee
the
functioning
of
the

it
was
agreed
that

the
work
of
this
group
refers
to
the
points
on
testing
in
the
abolition
statement
working
for
a
truly
comprehensive
test
ban
that
prevents
development
of
nuclear
weapons
and
for
the
closure
of
the
test
sites
the
ctbt
negotiations
are
now
underway
in
geneva
the
test
ban
will
most
likely
not
be
comprehensive
because
the
nuclear

states
have
developed
the
technical

to
replace

the
group
is
campaigning
to
get
language
introduced
into
the
preamble
of
the
ctbt
language
available
from
jackie

that
will
specifically
refer
to
the
prevention
of
the
development
of

as
the
intention
of
the

the
concept
of
the
test

beyond
is
to
favour
an
early
conclusion
of
the

while
recognising
that
this
will
not
fulfil

therefore
planning
for

plans
to

of

at

are
around
the
issues
of
banning

completely
i

destroying

piles
and
the
production
of
fissile

in
the
civilian
sector
if
the
stockpiles
remain
the
present
status
quo
will
be
perpetuated
as
with
th
e
npt
and
most
likely
with
the
ctbt
that
the
declared
nuclear
weapons
states
retain
their
capability
while
forbidding
it
for
all
others
this
is
not
disarmament
disallowing
fissile
material
production
only
in
the
military
and
not
in
the
civilian
sector
repeats
the
mistake
of
the
npt
by
ignoring
that
nuclear
energy
produces
bomb
material
that
can
be
diverted
legally
or
illegally
for
military
purposes
the
question
of
