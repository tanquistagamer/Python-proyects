immigrants
come
from
and
their
reasons
for
coming
here
in
response
to
the
incredible
demand
for
permission
to
enter
this
country
the
federal
government
has
established
a
complex
set
of
laws
that
determines
who
may
enter
this
country
and
for
what
reasons
this
chapter
discusses
legal

citizenship
united
states
citizens
have
a
right
to
travel
to
and
live
in
the
united
states
and
enjoy
the
fullest
protection
of
united
states
laws
people
who
are
not
citizens
of
the
united
states
usually
must
have
a
visa
to
enter
and
may
not
enjoy
the
protection
of
all
united
states
laws
a
person
can
become
a
united
states
citizen
either
through
birth
or
through
a
process
known
as
naturalization
a
person
can
be
a
united
states
citizen
from
birth
either
by
being
born
here
or
by
being
born
in
a
foreign
country
but
having
a
parent
who
is
a
citizen
of
the
united
states
anyone
born
in
the
united
states
has
automatic
citizenship
regardless
of
the
parents
citizenship
and
even
if
both
parents
are
living
in
this
country
illegally
at
the
time
of
the
child
s
birth
the
only
exception
is
that
children
born
to
foreign
diplomats
in
the
united
states
do
not
get
automatic
citizenship
anyone
not
born
a
citizen
must
be
naturalized
to
become
a
citizen
occasionally
a
group
of
people
is
naturalized
by
treaty
or
by
act
of
congress
usually
a
person
goes
through
the
process
individually
aliens
immigrants
nonimmigrants
and
residents
an
alien
is
a
citizen
of
any
country
other
than
the
united
states
a
person
who
comes
here
to
stay
permanently
is
called
an
immigrant
someone
who
intends
to
return
to
his
or
her
country
of
origin
is
called
a
nonimmigrant
even
if
he
or
she
intends
to
stay
for
a
substantial
period
of
time
for
example
a
student
might
stay
in
the
united
states
many
years
to
complete
an
education
and
still
be
considered
a
nonimmigrant
the
distinction
between
immigrant
and
nonimmigrant
is
crucial
permission
to
enter
as
a
nonimmigrant
often
is
easier
to
get
than
permission
to
enter
as
an
immigrant
so
some
people
are
tempted
to
claim
they
intend
to
return
to
their
home
country
in
order
to
enter
this
country
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service
ins
is
aware
of
this
temptation
and
often
will
deny
a
nonimmigrant
visa
application
to
anyone
suspected
of
wanting
to
remain
permanently
also
being
granted
a
nonimmigrant
visa
sometimes
can
make
it
more
difficult
to
get
an
immigrant
visa
later
a
permanent
resident
is
an
alien
who
has
been
given
permission
to
live
permanently
in
the
united
states
in
a
dispute
with
the
ins
over
an
applicant
s
true
intent
the
applicant
always
bears
the
burden
of
proving
intent
to
remain
here
temporarily
for
some
people
this
burden
is
nearly
impossible
to
overcome
for
example
the
spouse
of
a
permanent
resident
normally
must
wait
over
two
years
for
available
immigrant
visas
if
he
or
she
claims
to
want
to
visit
only
temporarily
he
or
she
must
overcome
the
presumption
that
a
married
person
would
want
to
remain
permanently
with
his
or
her
spouse
the
visa
system
a
visa
is
a
stamp
in
a
person
s
passport
that
gives
him
or
her
conditional
approval
to
enter
the
united
states
most
matters
involving
visas
are
handled
by
the
ins
most
aliens
apply
for
visas
from
a
consulate
or
embassy
of
the
united
states
in
the
alien
s
home
country
citizens
of
some
countries
primarily
european
countries
and
japan
may
enter
the
united
states
for
up
to
days
without
a
visa
to
be
eligible
citizens
of
these
countries
must
show
the
ins
that
they
have
a
return
ticket
home
and
that
they
intend
to
engage
in
a
type
of
business
or
tourist
activity
that
would
be
allowed
under
a
b
visa
described
below
canadian
citizens
generally
do
not
need
visas
to
enter
temporarily
in
some
instances
they
must
obtain
ins
approval
in
advance
if
they
are
coming
here
to
work
congress
establishes
a
complex
set
of
quotas
that
limits
the
number
of
visas
that
can
be
granted
for
most
types
of
visas
whether
an
applicant
receives
a
visa
depends
on
the
type
of
visa
requested
the
applicant
s
reason
for
traveling
to
the
united
states
and
the
applicant
s
country
of
origin
probably
the
most
important
element
to
obtaining
a
visa
successfully
is
knowing
for
which
visa
category
to
apply
for
certain
categories
of
visas
and
certain
countries
of
origin
an
applicant
can
wait
many
years
before
he
or
she
even
will
be
considered
for
a
visa
sometimes
the
wait
would
be
much
shorter
if
the
applicant
applied
for
a
different
type
of
visa
unfortunately
once
an
applicant
applies
for
one
type
of
visa
it
can
be
difficult
to
change
the
application
to
another
class
of
visa
for
this
reason
it
is
wise
to
consult
an
immigration
attorney
before
applying
for
any
kind
of
visa
nonimmigrant
visas
there
are
different
kinds
of
nonimmigrant
visas

by
the
letters
a

available
for
persons
who

not
intend
to
remain

the
united

represented
in
the

of

for

throughout
the

under

countries
and

education
or
two
years
of

or
experience
in

refugees
and
asylees
also
receive
special
treatment
a

is
a
refugee
if
he
or
she
is
outside
the
united

is
fleeing
or
has
fled
his
or
her
country
and
has
a
well

will
be
persecuted
because
of
race
religion
nationality
membership
in

or

opinion
an
asylee
is
an
alien
already
in

who
like
a
refugee
has
a
well
founded
fear
of
persecution
if
returned
to
his
or

home
country
the
president
and
congress
decide
each
year
the
total
number
of

and
asylees
to
accept

country
occasionally
congress
grants
immigrant
visas
allotted
for
individuals
from
specific
countries
according
to
political
factors
recent
programs
have
included
china
hong
kong
and
tibet
entry
and
exclusion
a
visa
only
gives
conditional
approval
to
enter
the
country
once
an
alien
arrives
in
the
united
states
with
a
visa
he
or
she
must
apply
for
entry
from
ins
officials
at
the
point
of
entry
for
most
aliens
this
is
a
mere
formality
but
the
ins
can
exclude
persons
with
valid
visas
for
a
variety
of
reasons
including
communicable
diseases
physical
or
mental
disorders
that
pose
a
threat
to
others
drug
addiction
or
criminal
history
involvement
in
espionage
or
terrorist
activity
against
the
united
states
government
or
its
people
is
grounds
for
exclusion
the
secretary
of
state
also
has
broad
discretion
to
bar
entry
of
anyone
whose
presence
would
have
an
adverse
effect
on
the
foreign
policy
of
the
united
states
sometimes
waivers
are
available
for
aliens
who
otherwise
would
be
denied
entry
for
certain
reasons
for
example
the
child
of
a
united
states
citizen
may
be
granted
a
waiver
to
enter
to
receive
treatment
for
drug
addiction
getting
a
green
card
and
becoming
a
naturalized
citizen
becoming
a
permanent
resident
is
the
first
step
that
an
alien
must
take
to
become
a
naturalized
american
citizen
people
with
permission
to
live
in
the
united
states
permanently
are
issued
green
cards
that
allow
them
to
work
with
few
restrictions
a
permanent
resident
can
apply
to
become
a
naturalized
citizen
after
five
years
or
three
years
if
married
to
a
united
states
citizen
the
ins
is
diligent
in
investigating
marriages
between
united
states
citizens
and
aliens
to
ensure
that
aliens
do
not
become
permanent
residents
through
sham
marriages
immigration
law
specifies
that
an
alien
seeking
permanent
residence
based
on
a
marriage
to
a
united
states
citizen
of
less
than
two
years
first
is
granted
conditional
permanent
resident
status
after
two
years
the
husband
and
wife
must
apply
to
the
ins
to
remove
this
conditional
status
deportation
deportation
is
the
expulsion
of
an
alien
who
entered
the
united
states
illegally
or
entered
legally
but
has
done
something
to
become
deportable
with
few
exceptions
any
violation
of
the
conditions
of
a
visa
no
matter
how
minor
is
grounds
for
deportation
to
a
person
s
country
of
origin
conviction
for
any
crime
but
the
most
minor
is
also
grounds
for
deportation
deportation
can
delay
an
alien
whose
long
term
goal
is
to
live
permanently
in
this
country
after
being
deported
aliens
are
forbidden
to
re
enter
the
country
for
five
years
aliens
deported
for
aggravated
felonies
such
as
drug
smuggling
are
barred
from
re
entry
for
years
or
may
be
barred
permanently
the
delay
in
returning
to
the
united
states
may
be
even
greater
for
aliens
from
countries
with
long
waiting
lists
returning
home
under
a
deportation
order
may
result
in
the
embassy
s
refusal
to
entrust
the
individual
with
another
temporary
visa
there
are
a
number
of
remedies
to
deportation
especially
if
the
deportable
person
has
lived
in
the
united
states
for
a
long
time
building
a
life
that
demonstrates
good
moral
character
even
if
the
deportable
individual
has
not
been
here
long
there
may
be
certain
waivers
or
defenses
to
deportation
among
the
most
common
is
asking
the
court
for
voluntary
departure
which
allows
the
individual
to
depart
the
united
states
on
his
or
her
own
in
any
case
anyone
facing
deportation
should
seek
the
advice
of
counsel
