assumptions
in
addition

the
locally

upon
their
local
areas
have
you
been
sic
ed
lefm
updates
from
march
will
also
include
data
from
the
census
of
employment
the
first
data
set
at
a
local
level
released
on
the
basis
of
the
sic
classification
this
is
a
major
reclassification
from
sic
some
problems
were
initially
evident
in
the
data
released
by
nomis
with
some
inconsistencies
in
the
areas
and
these
data
were
withdrawn
and
re
released
also
the
dual
classified
data
essential
for
understanding
the
effect
of
the
changes
at
local
level
have
only
just
been
released
and
very
interesting
they
are
too
users
of
these
data
will
know
that
the
sic
revision
has
required
a
major
reclassification
of
employment
by
the
office
of
national
statistics
ons
has
been
formed
from
the
merger
of
opcs
and
cso
with
overnight
some
of
uk
manufacturing
employment
being
reclassified
into
business
services
local
analysts
will
need
to
look
carefully
at
the
changes
in
their
own
local
data
sets
and
in
principle
this
is
best
done
with
the
data
since
it
is
dual
coded
although
is
a
fuller
data
set
census
of
employment
time
series
are
the
major
guide
to
economic
restructuring
at
the
local
level
so
that
this
break
in
the
series
will
be
a
major
concern
to
local
practitioners
the
good
news
is
that
in
future
these
data
will
be
available
annually
from
ons
with
less
than
a
year
s
delay
although
based
on
a
sample
rather
than
a
full
census
ce
ier
have
assessed
the
dual
classified
information
just
released
for
and
have
established
a
linkage
procedure
for
constructing
consistent
series
for
local
authorities
will
have
the
advantage
of
access
to
detailed
information
on
the
reclassification
of
their
local
firms
and
we
are
happy
to
work
with
local
agencies
with
lefm
if
they
want
to
undertake
a
more
thorough
analysis
of
their
local
data
sets
so
as
to
establish
an
agreed
consistent
data
series
at
their
local
level
more
on
these
items
and
other
data
changes
at
the

this
conference
is
now
an
established
annual

the
major

practical
issues
with

this
is
set
to
become
a
major
conference
for
local
economy
practitioners
and
we
wish
to
reflect
this
in
the
content
of
the
conference
as
last
year
it
will
be
a
two
day
event
held
on
thursday

in
the
scarman

this
gives
state
of
the

all
in
a

just
the
forum
for
a
series
of
stimulating
presentations
this
year
in
addition
to
contributions
from
ce
and
ier
there
will
be
a
number
of
external
speakers
at
this
year
s
event
to
complement
the
formal
sessions
on
important
new
lefm
developments
and
advice
on
how
to
get
the
most
out
of
new
data
available
at
local
level
a
broad
theme
for
this
year
will
be
to
cover
the
issues
of
partnership
building
and
developing
local
economic
strategies
this
reflects
our
awareness
that
many
users
are
seeing
the
role
of
their
organisations
both
deepen
and
broaden
as
a
consequence
they
are
frequently
being
asked
to
provide
economic
context
and
support
for
locally
based
initiatives
involving
partnerships
often
in
groups
involving
local
authorities
tec
lecs
chambers
government
offices
and
business
links
such
partnership
building
has
been
important
in
attracting
inward
investment
users
also
face
increasing
calls
for
evaluation
of
their
own
agency
s
work
and
its
impact
on
local
economic
activity
lefm
can
provide
a
suitable
framework
for
such
an
evaluation
the
speakers
will
review
the
issues
involved
and
draw
lessons
from
a
number
of
recent
projects
involving
impact
analysis
and
policy
evaluation
for
local
partners
there
will
also
be
plenty
of
formal
and
informal
opportunities
to
talk
to
speakers
designers
and
other
lefm
users
and
to
gain
or
improve
hands
on
experience
using
the
lefm
software
there
will
be
lefm
practical
sessions
for
novices
and
for
more
experienced
practitioners
and
opportunities
to
receive
one
to
one
based
advice
from
our
expert
team
indeed
there
will
be
time
to
interrogate
software
designers
if
necessary
continuing
late
into
the
night
in
the
conference
bar
between
sessions
and
in
the
morning
and
evening
as
our
participants
discovered
last
year
one
can
also
take
advantage
of
the
university
s
splendid
facilities
for
sport
with
extensive
walks
available
in
the
beautiful

eulefm
a
local
economy
forecasting
model
for
europe
is
under
development
a
german
language
version
of
lefm
has
been
developed
for
use
in
the
new
l
auml
nder
of
germany
in
cooperation
with
ecometrika
gmbh
in
berlin
this
is
designed
to
work
with
the
e
me
model
developed
by
a
team
led
by
cambridge
econometrics
for
europe
in
the
same
way
that
lefm
works
with
ce
s
mdm
national
regional
model
in
the
uk
the
e
me
model
was
developed
under
the
european
commission
s
joule
ii
r
amp
d
programme
and
distinguishes
some
industry
sectors
the
e
me
project
began
in
with
the
aim
of
developing
a
single
regionalised
model
of
europe
designed
to
evaluate
policies
to
reduce
greenhouse
gas
emissions
by
some
over
the
next
years
a
proposal
to
enhance
the
model
and
extend
it
to
cover
new
member
states
has
been
accepted
under
the
joule
iii
programme
and
this
will
form
the
starting
point
for
the
next
phase
of
research
recent
applications
among
significant
recent
model
developments
for
lefm
has
been
work
enhancing
the

work
for
the
brent
regeneration
agency
the

has
overall
responsibility
for
monitoring
the

document
spd
for
merseyside
designed
to
facilitate
convergence
of
merseyside
towards
average
european
income
levels
over
work
on
the
spd
was
originally
undertaken
in
by
ce
and
ier
they
used
version
lefm
software
model
to
help
set
quantitative
baseline
targets
for
eu
support
on
infrastructure
and
human
resources
these
targets
were
subsequently
embodied
in
merseyside
the
eu
approved
spd
providing
the
basis
for
implementation
of
the
detailed
programme
this
work
was
followed
up
in
with
a
second
project
giving
an
interim
assessment
of
the
programme
after
two
years
and
reviewing
the
guidance
on
approvals
this
follow
up
work
was
undertaken
for
the
labour
market
strategy
group
representing
merseyside
government
office
local
tecs
local
authorities
and
others
in
close
association
with
kpmg
s
liverpool
office
it
used
an
enhanced
version
evalefm
model
to
provide
an
up
to
date
counterfactual
scenario
ie
an
assessment
of
what
the
local
economy
might
have
achieved
if
the
objective
programme
had
not
occurred
and
compared
this
with
a
baseline
forecast
simulation
a
number
of
variant
future
development
scenarios
were
simulated
reflecting
enhanced
support
for
clusters
of
export
oriented
sectors
in
the
local
area
the
evalefm
model
was
thereby
used
to
underpin
effective
labour
market
policy
advice
the
work
informed
the
dissemination
of
guidance
for
applicants
for
funds
in
and
supported
the
information
requirements
of
local
economic
development
agencies
the
outcome
merseyside

established
a
consensus
approach
for
the
many
participating
agencies
allowing
them
to
support
the
recommended
new
initiatives
to
achieve
the
programme
objectives
lefm
was
seen
by
the
partners
as
a
fundamental
tool
for
achieving
a
consensus
among
the
partner
organisations
since
it
provided
a
clear
framework
for
considering
the

lefm
software
provided
the
framework
for
an
economic

economy
for
a

group
comprising
the
government
office
for
the

and
the
seven
local

areas
in
close
consultation
with
the

research
group
the
work
was
guided
by
a

utilising
a
lefm
for
each
of
the
seven
areas
consistent
with
the

forecasts
from
the
study
toyota
impact
analysis
of
historical
behaviour
and
trends
is
not
always
a
good
guide
to
future
events
major
discontinuities
can
arise
as
a
result
of
closures
of
large
organisation
or
substantial
inward
investment
the
lefm
package
is
designed
to
allow
users
to
address
such
issues
explicitly
using
an
impact
module
this
has
been
used
to
assess
the
impact
of
both
phase
and
phase
of
the
toyota
investment
in
burnaston
in
derbyshire
the
former
is
a
retrospective
analysis
of
what
the
effects
of
phase
have
been
while
the
analysis
of
phase
is
prospective
in
both
cases
the
lefm
software
enables
an
analysis
of
both
direct
and
indirect
effects
of
the
investment
on
the
local
economy
the
results
illustrate
the
substantial
effect
that
the
toyota
investment
has
had
on
the
local
area
in
total
some
jobs
will
have
probably
been
created
in
the
south
derbyshire
area
by
the
end
of
phase
of
which
about
a
third
are
indirect
the
package
also
enables
an
assessment
of
the
sensitivity
of
these
conclusions
to
a
range
of
alternative
assumptions

bodies
are
very
much
the
vogue
some
have
been
going
strong
for
a
number
of
years
a
good
case
in
point
is
the
partnership
between

and
leicestershire
county
council
they
have
been
working
together
in
producing
a
labour

the
last
four
years
their
most
recent
publication
leicestershire

published
jointly
by
the

is
based
on
the
use
of

lefm
has
provided
a
framework
which
the
partners
have
used
to
work
together
and
develop
their
own
view
of
local
economic
and
labour
market
prospects
this
has
included
linking
the
lefm
results
with
detailed
demographic
modelling
and

work
undertaken

the
dramatic
changes
under

in
the
further

higher
educational
system
and
related
organisations
have
highlighted
the
need
for

and

educational
establishments
are
now
charged
with
ensuring
that
their
courses
have
relevance
to
the
local

national
economies
the
reorganisation
of
the
way
in
which
careers

is
delivered
has
also
focused
the
attention
of
some
careers
advisors
on
how

can
make
