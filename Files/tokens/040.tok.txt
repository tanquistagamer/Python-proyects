s
unique
contributions
to
earth

and
monitoring
are
its
capability
to
measure
from

the
radar

of
the

at
three
different
wavelengths
and
to
make
measurements
for
different
polarizations
at
two
of
those

will
help

understand
the

behind
some
of

such
as
those
produced
by

will
use
the

antenna
structure
actually
consists
of
three
individual
antennas
one
operating
at
l

cm
wavelength
one
at
c
band
cm
wavelength
and
the
third
at
x
band
cm
wavelength
the
l
band
and
c
band
antennas
are
constructed
from
separate
panels
that
can
measure
both
horizontal
and
vertical
polarizations
the
sir
c
x
sar
antenna
is
the
most
massive
piece
of
hardware
at
a
total
of
kilograms
ever
assembled
at
the
jet
propulsion
laboratory
and
measures
meters
by

the
sir
c
instrument
was
built
by
jpl
and
the
ball
communication
systems
division
for
nasa
and
provides
the
l
band
and
c
band
measurements
at
different
polarizations
the
l
band
and
c
band
antennas
employ
phased
array
technology
which
allows
the
antenna
beam
pointing
to
be
adjusted
electronically
the
x

instrument
is
built
by
the
dornier
and
alenia
spazio
companies
for
dara
and
asi
and
operates
at
a
single

the
x

antenna
is
a
slotted
waveguide
type
which
uses
a
mechanical
tilt
to
change
the
beam
pointing
direction
sir

during
a
week
long
shuttle
flight
sir
c

will
image
an
area
of
roughly
million
square
kilometers
of
the
earth
s
surface
this
corresponds
to
a
total
of
hours
of

the
peak

rate
will
be
megabits
or

the

collected
will
be
processed
into

with
resolution
selectable
from

the
width
of
the
area
mapped
out
by
the

will
vary
from
to
kilometers
depending
on
how
the
radar
is
operated
and
the
direction
in
which
the
antenna
beams
are
pointing
data
from

will
be
used
to
develop
automatic
techniques
for
extracting

from

in
preparation
for
the

sir

will
provide

these
vertically

will
be
received
on
two

so
that

resulting
in
a

for

because

is
most
strongly
influenced
by

comparable
in

the

is
composed
of
two

embedded
in
