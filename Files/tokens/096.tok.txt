summary
operations
continued
very
smoothly
the
decision
was
made
to
continue
interferometry
data
takes
but
to
allow
the
orbit
to
slowly
begin
drifting
to
develop
a
data
set
with
a
large
variety
of
baselines
tests
were
run
to
help
develop
confidence
in
the
recorded
now
occupying
the

the
spare
recorder
and
power
supply
had
been
put
into
this
position
to
replace
the
original
recorder
in
this
position
it
was
determined
that
the
spare
was
recording
properly
but
had
a
cross
speed
playback
tracking
problem
the
tapes
being
recorded
were
good
the

were
switched
to
the
backup
units
to
evaluate
their
health
as

the
final
science
press
briefing
was
held
the
emphasis
was
on
the
interferometry
results
which
include
detection
of
change
between

flights
in
the

caldera
in

the
kiluaea

the

were
on
