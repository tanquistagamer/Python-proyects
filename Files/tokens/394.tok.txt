law
each
year
thousands
of
illinois
employees
suffer
work
related
injuries
like
many
other
states
illinois
has
a
workers
compensation
system
to
compensate
employees
for
accidental
injuries
occurring
in
the
workplace
all
employers
subject
to
the
illinois
workers
compensation
act
must
either
carry
workers
compensation
insurance
or
demonstrate
that
they
are
self
insured
and
have
the
financial
resources
to
cover
any
reasonably
anticipated
claims
employees
may
obtain
information
about
coverage
from
their
employers
or
from
the
illinois
industrial
commission
workers
compensation
law
is
complicated
and
its
regulations
and
procedures
frequently
change
a
worker
with
questions
concerning
workers
compensation
should
consult
an
attorney
particularly
after
suffering
an
injury
this
chapter
provides
an
outline
of
illinois
workers
compensation
program
other
employment
issues
including
discrimination
against
persons
with
disabilities
are
discussed
in
the
employment
law
chapter
workers
compensation
the
basics
workers
compensation
is
a
state
program
that
requires
employers
to
have
insurance
policies
covering
employees
for
work
related
injuries
when
an
employee
is
accidentally
injured
on
the
job
the
employer
or
the
insurance
company
pays
for
medical
care
and
lost
wages
due
to
the
injury
regardless
of
fault
no
part
of
the
premium
or
benefits
can
be
charged
to
employees
the
notion
of
employers
paying
for
employee
work
related
injuries
originated
in
germany
during
the
latter
half
of
the
th
century
among
the
chief
proponents
of
a
german
workers
compensation
program
was
bertha
von
krupp
of
the
famed
german
manufacturer
krupp
works
krupp
had
long
believed
that
taking
care
of
workers
was
in
the
best
interest
of
business
and
in
successfully
persuaded
chancellor
otto
von
bismark
to
support
workers
compensation
for
all
of
germany
workers
compensation
came
to
the
united
states
in
about
when
new
york
and
massachusetts
adopted
programs
illinois
adopted
its
workers
compensation
program
in
this
program
is
administered
by
the
illinois
industrial
commission
the
advent
of
workers
compensation
relieved
injured
employees
from
having
to
sue
their
employers
to
collect
any
sort
of
damages
before
workers
compensation
an
employee
had
to
prove
that
the
employer
had
negligently
failed
to
provide
a
safe
work
environment
this
was
often
difficult
and
resulted
in
many
injured
workers
going
without
compensation
under
workers
compensation
however
employees
usually
collect
benefits
regardless
of
fault
that
is
even
if
an
employee
is
responsible
for
his
or
her
own
accidental
injury
the
employee
is
covered
by
workers
compensation
under
most
circumstances
as
long
as
the
injury
occurred
on
the
job
the
main
restriction
to
the
program
is
that
in
most
cases
workers
compensation
benefits
are
the
only
form
of
remedy
for
workplace
injuries
after
receiving
benefits
an
injured
employee
may
not
sue
his
or
her
employer
for
further
compensation
who
is
covered
employers
illinois
has
a
two
tiered
system
for
providing
workers
compensation
coverage
certain
employers
are
required
to
have
coverage
under
the
workers
compensation
act
this
group
includes
all
government
and
school
agencies
as
well
as
those
who
employ
domestic
workers
in
their
homes
at
least
hours
per
week
for
or
more
weeks
per
year
it
also
includes
businesses
that
are
declared
to
be
extrahazardous
under
the
law
the
following
businesses
are
extrahazardous
most
manufacturing
construction
and
development
companies
food
and
beverage
providers
beauty
shops
mining
industries
certain
small
businesses
may
elect
not
to
be
covered
even
if
they
fall
generally
into
one
of
the
statutory
categories
employers
who
are
not
automatically
required
to
carry
coverage
under
the
workers
compensation
act
may
elect
to
do
so
voluntarily
or
they
may
elect
to
be
self
insured
in
illinois
passed
legislation
that
encourages
businesses
to
apply
for
self
insurer
status
selection
of
one
option
does
not
however
preclude
an
employer
from
changing
to
the
other
status
at
a
later
date
regardless
of
the
option
selected
every
employer
must
post
notices
in
the
workplace
that
provide
employees
with
the
name
business
address
and
telephone
number
of
the
person
service
company
or
insurance
company
to
contact
for
information
regarding
the
coverage
employees
at

are
eligible
for

benefits
broadly
defined
an
employee
is
anyone
under
oral
or
written
appointment
or
contract
for
hire
working
on
a
full
or
part
time
basis
this

work
exclusively
on
commission
and
independent
contractors
or
anyone
who
is
not
subject
to
the
control
and
direction
of
the
employer
an
employee
s
injury
must
arise
out
of
and
in
the
course
of
employment
to
be
covered
by
workers
compensation
basically
this
means
that
the
injury
has
to
occur
while
the
employee
is
involved
in
some
activity
directly
related
to
his
or
her
job
for
example
an
employee
injured
at
the
job
site
while
performing
tasks
at
the
direction
of
the
employer
is
covered
an
employee
who
is
injured
on
a
business
trip
is
covered
as
long
as
the
employee
is
engaged
in
employment
duties
workers
compensation
coverage
even
extends
to
an
emergency
situation
in
which
an
employee
leaves
work
intending
to
save
life
or
property
under
illinois
law
however
an
employee
is
not
covered
during
volunteer
work
related
or
work
sponsored
recreational
events
such
as

events

was
assigned
or
ordered
by
his
or
her
supervisor
to
participate
an
employee
is
not
covered
while
traveling
to
or
from
the
place
of
employment
unless
the
employer
asks
the
employee
to
perform
a
special
duty
on
the
way
employees
injured
during
work
breaks
when
no
work
is
being
performed
also
may
not
be
covered
depending
on
the
circumstances
nature
of
injury
workers
compensation
benefits
primarily
cover
accidental
injuries
accidental
injuries
are
those
that
happen
unexpectedly
without
design
or
plan
this
includes
many
repetitive
stress
injuries
such
as
carpal
tunnel
syndrome
as
well
as
heart
attacks
strokes
or
other
physical
problems
caused
by
work
in
addition
to
accidental
injuries
an
employee
also
may
recover
if
a
pre
existing
physical
condition
is
made
worse
by
his
or
her
work
workers
compensation
does
not
cover
injuries
caused
by
intentional
acts
of
assault
or
aggression
by
an
employer
or
a
fellow
employee
for
those
types
of
injuries
an
employee
would
seek
compensation
in
the
civil
courts
available
benefits
workers
compensation
entitles
an
employee
to
all
reasonable
and
necessary
medical
care
related
to
the
injury
to
payments
for
lost
wages
and
to
rehabilitation
and
training
under
the
illinois
workers
compensation
act
an
injured
employee
may
be
eligible
for
some
or
all
of
the
following
benefits
medical
services
including
all
reasonable
expenses
for
necessary
care
and
treatment
which
may
include
first
aid
visits
to
an
approved

provider
surgery
hospital
care
dental
or

for

the

is
unable
to

no

is
payable
however
for

of

for

expenses
and
benefits
to
dependents
of
the

an
employer
usually
cannot
be
made
to
pay
for
emotional
distress
pain
suffering
or
loss
of
companionship
affection
or
sexual
relations
workers
compensation
benefit
payments
are
not
considered
income
and
are
therefore
not
subject
to
state
or
federal
tax
the
employer
s
responsibilities
with
the
few
exceptions
described
above
all
illinois
employers
must
cover
their
employers
with
workers
compensation
insurance
the
cost
of
premiums
for
compensation
insurance
is
determined
by
factors
such
as
the
number
of
employees
a
business
has
how
safe
the
record
of
the
workplace
proves
to
be
and
how
much
employees
are
paid
the
trade
off
for
an
employee
s
relatively
simple
route
to
compensation
is
a
limit
to
the
amount
of
money
that
can
be
awarded
for
a
work
related
injury
employers
who
maintain
workers
compensation
insurance
programs
to
cover
on
the
job
injuries
are
immune
from
liability
unless
they
act
intentionally
to
cause
injury
coverage
under
the
act
does
not
however
limit
a
person
from
seeking
compensation
for
injuries
from
a
third
party
whose
negligence
may
have
contributed
to
the
injury
or
death
of
the
worker
employers
are
prohibited
from
harassing
discharging
or
threatening
any
employee
for
asserting
a
valid
claim
for
workers
compensation
benefits
it
is
illegal
for
an
employer
to
refuse
to
hire
or
rehire
an
individual
because
he
or
she
exercised
his
or
her
rights
under
the
workers
compensation
act
it
is
also
unlawful
for
an
employer
to
refuse
to
hire
or
rehire
an
employee
who
has
a
disabling
condition
from
a
prior
injury
however
if
an
employee
suffers
an
injury
that
is
made
worse
because
of
a
condition
existing
prior
to
the
time
of
