the
private
press
the
challenges
facing
independent
journalists
the
economic
challenges
facing
private
publishers
include
competition
a
small
pool
of
advertising
revenue
and
the
fluctuating
price
of
newsprint
on
the
international
market
publishers
also
complain
that
they
are
crippled
by
an
informal
ban
on
advertisements
placed
by
state
owned
institutions
in
the
private
press
by
the
refusal
of
government
media
to
accept
paid
promotional
advertising
from
private
newspapers
and
by
the
reported
warnings
that
private
businesses
have
received
about
the
repercussions
of
placing
advertisements
simultaneously
in
both
the
state
and
private
press
technologically
the
private
press
is
more
advanced
than
the
state
press
but
this
advantage
may
be
short
lived
because
the
government
is
now
three
years
into
a
major
modernization
program
for
its
news
organs
operating
on
shoestring
budgets
with
skeleton
staffs
many
private
newspapers
and
magazines
lay
out
their
publications
themselves
on
personal
computers
equipped
with
outdated
desktop
publishing
programs
that
are
modified
to
work
in
both
the
amharic
and
english
languages
using
laser
printers
to
prepare
camera
ready
page
proofs
self
taught
production
staffs
produce
the
most
basic
graphics
these
publications
would
greatly
benefit
from
access
to
more
sophisticated
technology
and
production
training
the
independent
press
publishes
products
that
vary
in
editorial
quality
and
political
analysis
english
language
newspapers
reflect
the
decline
of
english
language
instruction
in
the
educational
system
and
both
amharic
and
english
language
publications
reflect
the
negligible
editorial
skills
of
the
majority
of
practicing
journalists
some
newspapers
like
the
addis
tribune
and
the
monitor
which
have
been
accused
in
the
past
of
treading
too
carefully
to
avoid
the
perception
of
criticizing
the
government
are
now
covering
more
local
and
political
issues
as
well
as
press
freedom
and
human
rights
however
the
bulk
of
the
criticism
directed
squarely
at
the
government
can
be
found
in
publications
like
tobia
and
urji
which
are
regarded
as
political
opposition
papers
by
the
government
and
its
supporters
there
is
some
justification
for
the
government
s
view
some
independent
publishers
and
journalists
were
partisans
of
col
mengistu
others
of
the
late
emperor
haile
selassie
and
others
still
of
various
ethnic
insurgent
groups
this
however
does
not
justify
the
state
s
intolerance
of
the
expression
of
opposing
viewpoints
english
